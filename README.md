# Script Doctor

A screenplay analysis tool that uses the Save the Cat methodology to provide structural feedback on your screenplay beats.

## Project Status

ðŸš€ **UAT Round 2 Successfully Completed (April 2024)**
- All critical issues from UAT Round 1 have been resolved
- UI/UX improvements rated 10/10 for usability
- Beat definition accuracy issues resolved
- Analysis quality rated as "1000% better" than previous version
- Ready for limited release

## Features

- **Beat Analysis**: Analyze specific beats in your screenplay using the Save the Cat framework
- **Setup Verification**: Check for proper setup of story elements
- **Actionable Feedback**: Receive clear, actionable suggestions for improvement in Flag->Explain->Suggest format
- **RAG-Based Analysis**: Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation for accurate framework guidance
- **Intuitive UI**: Single text area with direct text highlighting and beat type selection

## Setup

1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file with your configuration:
```
GEMINI_FLASH_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

4. Place your Save the Cat framework document in the `data` directory:
```
data/save_the_cat.pdf
```

## Usage

1. Run the application using the start script:
```bash
./start.sh
```
   Or manually:
```bash
python run.py
```

2. Access the application at http://localhost:8000

3. Paste your screenplay outline into the text area

4. Highlight a specific beat section in your outline

5. Select the beat type from the dropdown menu

6. Click "Analyze Beat" to receive feedback

## How It Works

1. **Framework Document Ingestion**: The Save the Cat framework document is loaded, chunked, and indexed in ChromaDB
2. **Dynamic Outline Processing**: Your pasted outline is dynamically indexed for RAG-based analysis
3. **Multi-Stage Analysis**:
   - Definition Retrieval: Get the Save the Cat definition for the beat
   - Functional Analysis: Analyze how well the beat fulfills its structural function
   - Setup Check: Verify proper setup of story elements
   - Synthesis: Combine analyses into actionable feedback in Flag->Explain->Suggest format

## Future Enhancements

See `enhancement_plan.md` for details on planned improvements:
- Cross-beat analysis with better references to related beats
- Enhanced suggestion specificity with exact locations for proposed changes
- Optimization for limited release

## Development

- API runs on port 8000 by default
- Auto-reload enabled for development
- CORS middleware configured for frontend integration
- Environment variables supported via python-dotenv 

## Testing Documentation
