# Script Doctor - Key Fixes Being Validated in UAT Round 2

This document provides an overview of the critical issues identified in UAT Round 1 and the remediation measures implemented to address them. These are the key improvements that we're validating in UAT Round 2.

## 1. UI/UX Improvements

### Issue in UAT Round 1
- **Confusing dual text area design** requiring users to enter content twice
- Unclear interface for beat selection and highlighting
- Limited visual feedback during the analysis process

### Implemented Fixes
- Replaced dual-textarea design with a **single text area** and direct text highlighting
- Added clear step-by-step instructions in the UI
- Implemented **selection confirmation indicator** that shows the selected text
- Added visual feedback during processing (loading spinner)
- Created a beat reference section with descriptions for each beat type
- Enhanced form validation with clearer error messages

## 2. Beat Definition Accuracy

### Issue in UAT Round 1
- **Misidentification between similar beat types** (particularly "All Is Lost" vs "Dark Night of the Soul")
- Lack of clear distinction in analysis for adjacent beat types
- Retrieval of generic rather than specific beat definitions

### Implemented Fixes
- Enhanced PDF processor to extract individual beat definitions with clear separation
- Improved document loader to maintain distinct beat definitions during ingestion
- Added specific filtering for beat types to avoid confusion in ChromaDB queries
- Re-ingested framework document with properly separated beat definitions
- Implemented metadata tagging to help distinguish between similar beat types

## 3. Analysis Quality

### Issue in UAT Round 1
- **Inconsistent and sometimes irrelevant feedback**
- Lack of specific, actionable suggestions
- Generic responses not tailored to the selected beat type
- Setup checks not clearly integrated into the overall analysis

### Implemented Fixes
- Refined prompts for each stage of analysis (Definition, Functional, Setup, Synthesis)
- Enhanced LLM context by providing clearer beat definitions
- Improved synthesis of results into a more structured Flag->Explain->Suggest format
- Added more specific guidance for each beat type
- Better integration of setup checks into the final analysis
- Improved relevance scoring in ChromaDB queries

## 4. Technical Improvements

### Issue in UAT Round 1
- Incorrect model name format for the Gemini API
- Collection naming inconsistencies across the codebase
- Variable reference issues in analyzer.py
- Inadequate error handling and logging

### Implemented Fixes
- Updated model name to correct format ('models/gemini-1.5-flash-latest')
- Consolidated collection naming across the codebase
- Fixed variable reference issues in the analyzer component
- Improved error handling with detailed logging
- Enhanced the API endpoint with robust validation and error responses

## What to Look For During Testing

1. **UI Experience**: Is the single-textarea design more intuitive? Is the highlighting process clear?
2. **Beat Definition Clarity**: Do the analyses of "All Is Lost" and "Dark Night of the Soul" clearly distinguish between these beat types?
3. **Analysis Quality**: Are the suggestions more specific, relevant, and actionable?
4. **Overall Stability**: Does the application function without errors throughout the testing process?

## How to Evaluate Effectiveness

When testing the application, consider these evaluation guidelines:

### For UI/UX Improvements
- Compare the ease of use to the previous version (if you participated in Round 1)
- Note whether the highlighting process is intuitive
- Observe if the visual feedback helps guide you through the process
- Assess whether the instructions are clear enough to use without training

### For Beat Definition Accuracy
- Focus especially on the "Explain" section of the analysis
- For the All Is Lost beat, look for themes of:
  - The lowest moment for the protagonist
  - Major setback or loss
  - External pressures reaching their peak
- For the Dark Night of the Soul beat, look for themes of:
  - Internal reflection or despair
  - Emotional processing of the "All Is Lost" moment
  - The moment before finding a solution

### For Analysis Quality
- Assess whether the "Flag" clearly identifies a specific issue
- Check if the "Explain" section references relevant Save the Cat principles
- Evaluate if the "Suggest" section offers specific, actionable recommendations
- Note whether suggestions are generic or specific to your outline's content

Your feedback on these key areas will help us confirm that the remediation efforts have successfully addressed the issues identified in UAT Round 1.
