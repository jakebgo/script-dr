- **Issues**: 
  - Could better reference other beats in the outline when explaining setup issues
  - Needs more specific guidance on where exactly to make changes
- **Success Criteria Met**: YES (with enhancement opportunities)

### Stability & Regression
- **Rating**: Excellent
- **Key Feedback**:
  - "None detected." (for regression issues)
  - "None." (for unexpected behaviors or errors)
- **Issues**: None
- **Success Criteria Met**: YES

## Key Issues Identified

### Priority: Low - Enhancement Opportunities

1. **Cross-Beat Analysis Enhancement**
   - **Issue**: When analyzing a beat's setup, the system could be more specific about which previous beats should be modified
   - **Example**: "It's accurate but it's not referencing relevant past principles. It should probably reference the other places in the text (the other beats) that have led to this."
   - **Recommendation**: Enhance the prompt to specifically look for and reference earlier beats that need modification

2. **Location Specificity in Suggestions**
   - **Issue**: Suggestions sometimes lack specificity about where exactly in the outline to make changes
   - **Example**: "Insert scenes through Act Two-Aâ€¦" this should call out some places that might work."
   - **Recommendation**: Update the analysis logic to pinpoint specific locations or beat names for suggested changes

## Overall Assessment

UAT Round 2 has successfully validated that the remediation efforts following UAT Round 1 have effectively addressed all critical issues. The application now provides:
- An intuitive, easy-to-use UI with clear beat selection workflow
- Accurate distinction between similar beat types (especially All Is Lost vs. Dark Night of the Soul)
- Significantly improved analysis quality with relevant, actionable suggestions

The minor enhancement opportunities identified do not impact the core functionality and can be addressed in future iterations. The application is now ready for broader user testing or limited release.

## Next Steps
1. Complete final UAT documentation
2. Develop enhancement plan for addressing the minor issues identified
3. Prepare for limited release to a broader user group
