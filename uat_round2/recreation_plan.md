# Script Doctor - Plan for Recreating UAT Round 2 Documents

## Overview

Several key UAT Round 2 documents need to be recreated to ensure we have a complete set of testing materials. This plan outlines the approach and content guidelines for recreating each document.

## Documents to Recreate

### 1. Test Execution Guide (uat_round2_test_guide.md)

**Purpose:** Provide step-by-step instructions for executing each test case in UAT Round 2.

**Content Guidelines:**
- Include an introduction explaining the focus of UAT Round 2
- Provide detailed steps for each test case (TC-R2-01 through TC-R2-08)
- For each test case, include:
  - Objective
  - Prerequisites
  - Step-by-step instructions
  - Expected results
  - Evaluation criteria
- Include guidelines for reporting issues
- Add instructions for submitting feedback

**Priority:** HIGH - Required for testers to begin testing

### 2. Feedback Form (uat_round2_feedback_form.md)

**Purpose:** Provide a standardized template for testers to document their observations for each test case.

**Content Guidelines:**
- Include tester information (name, date, session, environment)
- Add test case information (ID, outline used, beat type analyzed)
- Include rating sections for:
  - UI Usability (Yes/No/Partially + Comments)
  - Beat Definition Accuracy (Yes/No + Comments)
  - Feedback Quality (1-5 scale + Comments)
  - Stability (Yes/No + Comments)
- Add specific questions about Round 1 issues being resolved
- Include open-ended feedback sections
- Add a section for test coordinator use

**Priority:** HIGH - Required for collecting consistent feedback

### 3. Results Tracker (uat_round2_results_tracker.md)

**Purpose:** Track and aggregate results from all testers to evaluate the success of the remediation efforts.

**Content Guidelines:**
- Include a summary table for all test cases
- Add sections for key metrics:
  - UI Usability
  - Beat Definition Accuracy
  - Feedback Quality
  - Stability
- Include detailed results for each test case
- Add a success criteria assessment section
- Include a section for conclusions and recommendations
- Add an appendix for new issues identified

**Priority:** MEDIUM - Required for analysis phase

### 4. Key Fixes (uat_round2_key_fixes.md)

**Purpose:** Summarize the key fixes implemented in the remediation plan that are being validated in UAT Round 2.

**Content Guidelines:**
- Include an overview of the remediation efforts
- For each key issue area (UI/UX, Beat Definition, Analysis Quality, Technical), include:
  - Description of the issue in UAT Round 1
  - Details of the fixes implemented
- Add a section on what to look for during testing
- Include guidelines for evaluating the effectiveness of the fixes

**Priority:** HIGH - Required for orienting testers to the focus areas
