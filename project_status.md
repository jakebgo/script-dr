# Script Doctor - Project Status Report

## Project Overview

Script Doctor is a screenplay analysis tool that leverages the Save the Cat methodology to provide structural feedback on screenplay beats. The application uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to analyze screenplay beats against the Save the Cat framework and provide actionable feedback.

## Current Implementation Status (MVP v5.2)

### Core Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **FastAPI Backend**: Provides RESTful endpoints for screenplay analysis
2. **RAG Implementation**: Retrieves relevant Save the Cat content and analyzes screenplay beats
3. **ChromaDB Integration**: Stores and retrieves document embeddings for semantic search
4. **LLM Integration**: Uses Google's Gemini Pro model for analysis and synthesis

### Key Components

#### API Layer (`src/rag/api.py`)
- **Endpoints**:
  - `GET /`: Serves the main HTML page
  - `GET /health`: Detailed health check with component status
  - `POST /analyze`: Beat analysis endpoint that returns relevant Save the Cat guidance
- **Request/Response Models**:
  - `SceneAnalysisRequest`: Contains `full_outline`, `designated_beat` (raw highlighted text), `beat_type`, and `num_results`
  - `AnalysisResult`: Contains `flag`, `explanation`, and `suggestions`
  - `SceneAnalysisResponse`: Focuses on the synthesized analysis result

#### Analysis Pipeline (`src/rag/analyzer.py`)
- **Multi-Stage Analysis**:
  1. **Definition Retrieval**: Gets the Save the Cat definition for the beat type
  2. **Functional Analysis**: Analyzes how well the beat fulfills its structural function
  3. **Setup Check**: Identifies and verifies necessary setups for elements in the beat
  4. **Synthesis**: Combines analyses into Flag->Explain->Suggest format
- **Dynamic Outline Indexing**: Indexes the user's pasted outline into ChromaDB for RAG-based analysis
- **Improved Prompts**: Enhanced prompts for better analysis and context

#### Document Processing (`src/rag/document_loader.py`)
- **Framework Document Ingestion**: One-time process for loading, chunking, and indexing the Save the Cat framework document
- **Support for Multiple Formats**: Handles JSON, TXT, and PDF formats
- **Text Chunking**: Splits text into semantic chunks with overlap for better context preservation

#### Vector Store (`src/rag/vector_store.py`)
- **ChromaDB Integration**: Persistent storage for document embeddings
- **Collection Management**: Creates and manages collections for different document types
- **Query Interface**: Provides semantic search functionality

#### Application Entry Point (`run.py`)
- **Framework Document Ingestion**: Automatically ingests the Save the Cat framework document on startup
- **Directory Structure**: Ensures necessary directories exist
- **FastAPI Server**: Runs the application on the configured port

### Configuration

The application uses environment variables for configuration:
- `GEMINI_FLASH_API_KEY`: API key for the Gemini Pro model
- `PORT`: Port for the FastAPI server (default: 8000)
- `HOST`: Host for the FastAPI server (default: 0.0.0.0)

### Data Flow

1. **Framework Document Ingestion**:
   - The Save the Cat framework document is loaded, chunked, and indexed in ChromaDB
   - This is a one-time process that happens on application startup

2. **User Interaction**:
   - User pastes their full screenplay outline
   - User selects a specific beat by highlighting text
   - User chooses the beat type from a dropdown

3. **Analysis Process**:
   - The user's outline is dynamically indexed into ChromaDB
   - The analysis pipeline retrieves the Save the Cat definition for the beat type
   - The pipeline analyzes the functional aspects of the beat
   - The pipeline checks for proper setup of story elements
   - The analyses are synthesized into actionable feedback

4. **Response**:
   - The application returns a structured response with:
     - Flag: One clear issue that needs attention
     - Explanation: Why this is important, referencing Save the Cat principles
     - Suggestions: 2-3 specific, actionable suggestions for improvement

## Technical Implementation Details

### ChromaDB Integration
- **Collection Structure**:
  - `save_the_cat`: Contains the Save the Cat framework document
  - `outline_{uuid}`: Temporary collections for user outlines
- **Embedding Model**: Uses sentence-transformers for generating embeddings
- **Chunking Strategy**: 1000 characters with 100 character overlap
- **Relevance Scoring**: Based on cosine similarity (1 - distance)

### LLM Prompt Engineering
- **Beat Definition Retrieval**:
  ```
  Explain the narrative function and purpose of the {beat_type} beat according to the Save the Cat framework.
  ```
- **Functional Analysis**:
  ```
  You are a screenplay structure expert. Analyze this beat's functional aspects:

  FULL OUTLINE:
  {outline}

  DESIGNATED BEAT:
  {beat}

  SAVE THE CAT DEFINITION:
  {definition}

  Analyze how well this beat fulfills its structural function. Consider:
  1. Does it achieve the expected narrative purpose?
  2. Does it create the right emotional impact?
  3. Does it properly connect to surrounding beats?

  Provide a detailed analysis focusing on strengths and weaknesses.
  ```
- **Setup Check**:
  ```
  Note: Identification of {elements} requires a preliminary processing step on the DESIGNATED BEAT text, 
  potentially using another LLM call or specific entity extraction logic, to identify key nouns/concepts 
  requiring setup.

  For each of these elements that need setup:
  {elements}
  
  Check this earlier part of the outline for proper setup:
  {outline}
  
  Identify any missing setups and explain why they're important.
  ```
- **Synthesis**:
  ```
  Synthesize these analyses into a clear, actionable review:

  FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS:
  {functional_analysis}

  SETUP ANALYSIS:
  {setup_analysis}

  Format the response as:
  FLAG: [One clear issue that needs attention]
  EXPLAIN: [Why this is important, referencing Save the Cat principles]
  SUGGEST: [2-3 specific, actionable suggestions for improvement]

  Keep each section concise and focused.
  ```

### Text Processing
- **Chunking Algorithm**: Splits text by paragraphs and combines them to maintain context
- **Overlap Handling**: Keeps some paragraphs for overlap between chunks
- **Metadata Tracking**: Tracks chunk index, source, and other metadata

## Dependencies

The application relies on the following key dependencies:
- `fastapi`: Web framework for building APIs
- `uvicorn`: ASGI server for running the FastAPI application
- `chromadb`: Vector database for storing and retrieving document embeddings
- `sentence-transformers`: For generating text embeddings
- `google-generativeai`: For accessing the Gemini Pro model

- The application showed acceptable degradation as input size increased
- Large outlines (~10-20x normal size) can be processed within acceptable time limits

### Concurrent Request Performance
- The application was tested with multiple concurrent requests (10 simultaneous users)
- Performance under concurrent load showed substantial improvement over sequential processing
- Concurrent processing achieved approximately 60-70% of theoretical maximum throughput

### Memory Usage Profiling
- Memory consumption was tracked during processing of different size inputs
- No significant memory leaks were detected
- Memory usage scales linearly with input size with acceptable bounds

### Component-Level Performance Analysis
- The analysis pipeline was broken down into components for detailed timing:
