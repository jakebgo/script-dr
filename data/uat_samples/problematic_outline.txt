TITLE: "THE RELIC HUNTER"
GENRE: Adventure/Thriller

ACT ONE

OPENING IMAGE: DR. ALEX FOSTER (40) carefully excavates a small artifact in a dimly lit cave. The camera pulls back to reveal he's actually in a museum exhibition, recreating a famous discovery for visitors.

SETUP: Alex is a once-renowned archaeologist now relegated to museum work after a controversial failed expedition. He's divorced, estranged from his teenage daughter LILY, and drowning in debt. His boss reminds him that the museum is cutting staff, and Alex's position isn't secure. Alex drinks too much and lives in a small apartment filled with books and artifacts.

CATALYST: Alex receives a mysterious package containing half of an ancient map and a note: "The Temple of Ashara exists. I have proof. Meet me." It's signed by his former colleague VICTOR, who disappeared three years ago during the expedition that ruined Alex's career.

DEBATE: Alex is skeptical but intrigued. He researches the map fragment and discovers it points to a location in the uncharted Amazon. He visits his ex-wife to borrow money, which leads to an argument about his obsessions destroying their family. His daughter Lily overhears and tells him he'll never change. Alex almost throws the map away but then notices a hidden marking that matches his own research from years ago.

BREAK INTO TWO: Alex pawns his most valuable personal artifact to buy a plane ticket to Brazil, determined to find Victor and restore his reputation.

ACT TWO

B STORY: In Brazil, Alex reluctantly teams up with GABRIELA, a local guide who happens to be Victor's sister. She blames Alex for abandoning her brother on the previous expedition but needs his expertise to find Victor. Their antagonistic relationship slowly reveals their shared passion for discovery and protection of indigenous artifacts.

FUN AND GAMES: Alex and Gabriela navigate the Amazon, following the map's clues. They escape river pirates, cross treacherous terrain, and discover ancient markers confirming they're on the right path. Alex displays impressive knowledge of archaeology and survival skills, earning Gabriela's grudging respect. They find several artifacts that suggest the Temple of Ashara is real, not a myth as most experts believe.

Back at the museum, Alex's boss discovers his unauthorized absence and threatens to fire him. Meanwhile, we see a shadowy figure tracking Alex's movements through the jungle.

MIDPOINT: Alex and Gabriela find Victor's abandoned camp. Among his belongings is the other half of the map and his journal, which reveals he discovered the temple's location but also warns of dangerous guardians. As they piece together the complete map, they're ambushed by mercenaries working for DOMINIC VEGA, a wealthy collector who wants the temple's treasures for himself. During the escape, Gabriela is wounded.

BAD GUYS CLOSE IN: Alex and Gabriela go into hiding in a local village. Gabriela's wound becomes infected, and she falls ill. The village elder, recognizing an amulet Victor gave to Gabriela, offers help but warns that the Temple of Ashara is cursed. While Gabriela recovers, Alex bonds with the villagers and learns more about the temple's history.

Vega bribes officials to declare Alex a wanted man for artifact smuggling. Vega's mercenaries approach the village. Alex calls his daughter, possibly for the last time, but the call drops before he can explain anything.

ALL IS LOST: Vega's men attack the village. Alex and Gabriela escape, but many villagers are hurt, and the elder is killed trying to protect them. Gabriela blames Alex for bringing this destruction and leaves him alone in the jungle. Without supplies or a guide, Alex is lost, injured, and being hunted. A torrential rainstorm washes away his map.

DARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL: Sheltering in a cave, Alex reflects on how his obsessions have cost him everything—his family, his career, and now innocent lives. He hallucinates a conversation with Victor, who reminds him why they became archaeologists: not for fame or treasure, but to preserve history. Alex realizes he needs to find the temple not for himself, but to protect it from people like Vega.

BREAK INTO THREE: Alex remembers key details from the map and Victor's journal. Using the stars and his knowledge of ancient navigation techniques, he determines the temple's location. He sets off, determined to reach it before Vega.

FINALE: Alex finds the temple but discovers Gabriela is already there—she didn't abandon him but went ahead to find her brother. They reconcile and enter the temple together, finding Victor barely alive in a hidden chamber. As they try to escape, Vega and his men arrive. A chase through the temple triggers ancient traps. Alex sacrifices a clear escape route to ensure ancient artifacts aren't destroyed, which impresses Gabriela.

The temple begins to collapse. Alex helps Victor and Gabriela escape but is trapped inside with Vega. Vega attempts to steal a central relic despite the temple falling apart. Alex chooses to leave the relic in place, respecting its significance, and barely escapes as Vega is crushed by debris.

Outside, government helicopters arrive—Lily had traced her father's call and alerted authorities about the illegal mercenary activity. In the aftermath, Alex declines to reveal the temple's location to the media or scientific community, stating that some discoveries should remain protected.

FINAL IMAGE: Three months later, Alex gives a lecture at the museum about indigenous archaeological preservation rather than spectacular discoveries. His approach has earned him new respect. Afterward, Lily visits him, and they begin rebuilding their relationship. Gabriela arrives with news that Victor has recovered and has invited them on a new, sanctioned expedition. Alex hesitates, looking at Lily, who encourages him to go—but this time, she's coming too.
