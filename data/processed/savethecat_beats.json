I would also\nlike to thank Ken Lee for his continuing support and enthusias m, and\nGina Mansfield, a true collaborator and artist. And most of all, I want\nto thank  Michael Wiese, who has created such a winning brand of\nbooks about every aspect of the film industry , and is also one of its\nmost proactive and successful participants. Finally , thanks for the\nencouragement I received from the gang \u201cin and out of these rooms,\u201d\nespecially Marin , Melanie, Rich, Lee, Lisa, Zed, Zak, Eric, Jake, and\nWendell. T rudge on!\nFOREWORD\nBy Sheila Hanahan Taylor , Producer at Zide/Perry Entertainmen t,\nwhose films include the American Pie  trilogy , Hellboy , Cats and Dogs,\nFinal Destination, Final Destination 2; Associate Professor , UCLA\nProducer \u2019s Program.\nWith the turn of EVER Y page of this book, I found myself using\nall of Blake Snyder\u2019s tools, hints, and ideas to double- and triple -check\nmy own projects that are set up and in development at studios all over\ntown! I love the idea that Blake  has written a book that everyone can\nuse \u2014 from the novice to the practicing producer . How often does that\nhappen?!\nI also found myself trying to come up with a way I could polite ly\nrefer Save the Cat!  to a number of repped, produce d writers who could\nuse a little goose from its tactics. Imagine what would happen in a\ntown where more writers approached screenwriting the way Blake\nsuggests? My weekend read would dramatically improve, both in\nsellable/produceable content and in discovering new writer s who\nunderstand the craft of storytelli ng and can be hired on assignment for\nideas we already have in house . (On second thought, are you SURE\nyou want this published, Blake? It might beef up the competition!)\nI\u2019ve been searching for a book that masterfully uses the kind of\n\u201csuccessful\u201d examples studio heads use (Miss Congeniality , Die Hard,\nLegally Blonde , Signs ) and peeks behind the curtain to explain them on\nall fronts \u2014 genre, plot, structure, marketing, casting \u2014 in a way that\nrookies and pros alike will understand and hopefully put to use. Save\nthe Cat! is like a Berlitz  guide to interpreting the secret language of\nevery studio exec and producer in town. Once you learn to think like\nthe people with the checkbook, you\u2019re one step closer to success.\nI\u2019m not exaggerating when I say at Zide/Perry \u2014 one of the\npremier homes for breaking new screenwriters and launching careers\n\u2014 we recomm end every single one of Blake\u2019 s strategies\u2026 from\nwatching movie s in the appropriate genre and breaking down all their\nkey elements, to asking what the poster/who the cast is, to showing\nhow using similar films as a benchmark is just good storytelling. When\nI picked up Save the Cat! it was like Blak e had been in our offices for\nthe last six years, hearing our words and recording them in a master\nbible.\nExperience shows that following the steps in Save the Cat!  works.\nI can name dozens of writers/producers who have launched their\ncareers using the philosophy described on these pages! It\u2019s invaluable.\nThank God, Blake has taken the time to put it all down in one efficient\nand witty place. And just like good exposition, the breezy writin g here\nmakes the instruction and insight sneak up on you. Before you know it,\nyou\u2019ve read the whole thing, learned a ton, and are still inspired to\ntackle your next project.\nBecause this book explores the craft of screenwriting starting\nfrom the business side of things, I consider it both essenti al and\nrevolutionary . Save the Cat! takes into account both halves of the\nwhole, for the route to success in this business is to strike a balance\nbetween art and commerce, and this book has done exactly that!\nJust like my invaluable collection of classic, great scripts, Save\nthe Cat! is a book to have on the shelf, right next to Syd Field\u2019 s. I\nwould absolutely revisit it whenever I find myself wanting a quick\nrefresher course on commercial screenplay structure and strategy .\nA final word: After reading dozens of how-to books, this is the\nFIRST book on screenwriting/t he business that I\u2019ve EVER asked the\nco-chairs at UCLA to consider making required reading. In fact, Save\nthe Cat! is, to me, a must-read for anyone who is even remotely\ninterested in being in the game.\nINTRODUCTION\nAnother  book on screenwriting!?\nI\u2019m sure that\u2019 s what many of you are thinking.\nAnd to an extent, you\u2019re right. There are lots of good scree n-\nwriting how-to\u2019 s out there. And if you want to see where it all began,\nlook to the master , Syd Field, who started it all and taught everybody .\nThere are other really good books and courses, too, many of\nwhich I\u2019ve sampled.\nI like Viki King \u2019s book with the improbable title of How to Write\na Movie in 21 Days . Improbable, yes, but I\u2019ve done  it \u2014 and sold the\nscript I wrote, too.\nI also value Joseph Campbell\u2019 s work. Hero With A Thousand\nFaces  remains the best book about storytelling ever .\nAnd of course I have a soft spot for Robert McKee \u2014 for the\nvalue of his class performance if nothing else. McKee is like John\nHouseman in The Paper Chase , and if you\u2019re an aspiring screenwriter ,\nyou have to take at least one seminar from him. It\u2019s too great a piece of\ntheater to miss.\nFinally , for anyone who\u2019 s watched lots of movies and seen\nenough bad ones to think \u201cI can do THA T!\u201d you may assum e you\ndon\u2019t need a \u201chow-to-write-a-screenplay\u201d book at all.\nSo why this one?\nWhy now?\nAnd why can I tell you things you\u2019ve never heard anywhere else\nthat will make a dif ference in your script?\nTo begin  with, what I\u2019ve never seen out there is a book on screen-\nwriting that \u201ctalks the way we talk.\u201d As a working professional in the\nentertainment industry , since I was eight doing voice work for my Dad,\nI\u2019m used to a certain slangy shorthand when it comes to discussing the\nbusiness. These books are all so academic! So sterile. They treat the\nmovies with waaaaaay too much awe and respect \u2014 they\u2019 re just\nmovies! \u2014 and I think that gets in the way. Wouldn\u2019 t it be nice if a\nbook about how to write a screenplay used the kind of shorthand that\nscreenwriters and movie executives use?\nSecondly , and this is no slight against anyone, but I think it would\nbe nice if the guy writing the book on how to write a screenplay had\nactually sold something! Don\u2019 t you think?  And this is an area where I\nfeel particularly qualified. I have been a working screenwriter for 20\nyears and made millions of dollars doing it. I\u2019ve sold lots of high\nconcept, bidding war , spec screenplays. I\u2019ve even had a couple made.\nI\u2019ve gotten script notes from Steven Spielber g, Michael Eisner ,\nJeffrey Katzenber g, Paul Maslansky , David Permut, David Kirschner ,\nJoe Wizan, Todd Black, Craig Baumgarten, Ivan Reitman, and John\nLandis. And I\u2019ve received the collective wisdom of many others \u2014\nless famous but equally wise \u2014 that we all use, and like, and base our\nscreenplays on.\nThirdly , wouldn \u2019t it be a bonus if the guy writing the how-to had\nactually used this method in the trenches by teaching others, who\nactually go on to sell scripts ?\nWell, that\u2019 s me, too.\nI\u2019ve had a long track record of working with other screenwriter s.\nI\u2019ve taught my method and shortcuts to some of the most successful in\nthe business. I\u2019ve helped make them better screenwriters. It\u2019s because\nmy approach to the task is practical, based on common sense \u2014 and\nmostly because it works.\nAnd lastly, I think it would be good if a screenwriting book told\nyou the truth about your chances of selling. There are tons of seminars\nand screenwritin g programs out there that seem designed to encourage\npeople and ideas that should not be encouraged. I don\u2019t know about\nyou, but I find this cruel. Advi ce like: \u201cFollow your heart!\u201d and \u201cBe\ntrue to your vision!\u201d is fine if you\u2019re in therapy . Me? I really want to\nimprove my odds. Life is short. I don\u2019t need to be misled into thinking\nmy script based on the life of St. Aloysius or a \u201ctrue-life even t\u201d that\nhappened to me at camp one summer actually has a chance if it\ndoesn\u2019 t.\nSo why another screenwriting book? Because the others I\u2019ve seen\ndon\u2019t say it like it is, and don\u2019t give the reader the tools to attain\nsuccess in the field. And on top of that, they often serve the writer of\nthe book more than the reader . I personally don\u2019t want a career\nteaching screenp lay writing courses; I just want to pass along what I\nknow . And besides all that, I\u2019m at the point when I\u2019m ready to \u201cgive it\naway .\u201d I\u2019ve had a lot of amazing  breaks, I\u2019ve learned from the masters,\nand now it\u2019 s time for me to tell you.\nI also undertook  the writing of this book because of the lack of\ncommon sense I see in many of the movies that get made today . For all\nthe know ledge out there, many in Hollywood forget the basics and\nignore what works, thinking that just because they have studio offices\nand big expense accounts, they don\u2019 t need to follow the rules anymore.\nAnd, frankly , this drives me up a tree!\nAs I am writing  this book, there is one phenomenon in particul ar\nthat really bothers me, and yet from a business point of view it\u2019s pretty\nsmart. It\u2019s the Make-Sure-It-Opens-Or -Else trend. This is where you\nspend a lot of money on the movie, hype the bejeezus out of it, open\nwide at 3,000+ theaters, and have a huge first weekend to recoup your\ncost. And who cares if your movie drops 70% or 80% in its second\nweekend because of bad word-of-mouth?\nWhat bugs me about this trend is that for all the money they\u2019re\nspending on star salaries, specia l effects, advertising, and marketing \u2014\nand don\u2019t forget all those prints \u2014 it would be better spent, and the\nmovies would be better too, if the filmmakers just paid $4 for some\npaper and pencils and followed the rules of how to write a good movie!\nTake a hip, slick movie like Lara Croft 2 for example. They spent\na fortune on that film. And every one is still wondering what happened.\nThey can\u2019t figure out why they didn\u2019 t bring in the audience of targeted\nmen. It\u2019s not surprising to me. What\u2019 s wrong with this picture? Where\ndid the filmmakers go awry? To me it\u2019s really very simple: I don\u2019t like\nthe Lara Croft character . Why would I? She\u2019s cold and humorles s. And\nwhile that\u2019s fine in the solitary  world of video games and comics, it\ndoesn\u2019 t make me want to leave my home to go see the movi e. The\npeople who produced this film think they can get you to like her by\nmaking her \u201ccool.\u201d This is what amounts to \u201ccharacter develop ment\u201d\nin au currant  movies: \u201cShe drives a cool car.\u201d That\u2019s someone\u2019 s idea\nof how to create a winning hero.\nWell, folks, I don\u2019t care about how \u201ccool\u201d it is, this isn\u2019t going to\nwork.\nWhy?\nBecause liking the person we go on a journey with is the single\nmost important element in drawing us into the story .\nWhich brings us to the title of this book: Save the Cat!\nSave the what?\nI call it the \u201cSave the Cat\u201d scene. They don\u2019t put it into movies\nanymore. And it\u2019s basic. It\u2019s the scene where we meet the hero and the\nhero does something \u2014 like saving a cat \u2014 that defines who he is and\nmakes us, the audience, like him.\nIn the thriller , Sea of Love , Al Pacino is a cop. Scene One finds\nhim in the middle of a sting operation. Parole violators have been lured\nby the promise of meeting the N.Y. Yankees, but when they arrive it\u2019s\nAl and his cop buddies waiting to bust them. So Al\u2019s \u201ccool.\u201d (He\u2019s got\na cool idea for a sting anywa y.) But on his way out he also does\nsomething nice. Al spots another lawbreaker , who\u2019 s brought his son,\ncoming late to the sting. Seeing the Dad with his kid, Al flashes his\nbadge at the man who nods in understanding and exits quick. Al lets\nthis guy off the hook because he has his young son with him. And just\nso you know Al hasn\u2019 t gone totally soft, he also gets to say a cool line\nto the crook: \u201cCatch you later\u2026 \u201d Well, I don\u2019t know about you, but I\nlike Al. I\u2019ll go anywhere he takes me now and you know what else?\nI\u2019ll be rooting to see him win. All based on a two second interaction\nbetween Al and a Dad with his baseball-fan kid.\nCan you imagine if the makers of Lara Cr oft 2 spent $4 on a good\nSave the Cat scene instead of the $2.5 million they spent deve loping\nthat new latex body suit for Angelina Jolie? They might\u2019ve done a\nwhole lot better .\nThat\u2019 s why the name of this book is Save The Cat! It\u2019s\nemblematic of the kind of common sense basics I want to get across to\nyou, and to some in the movie business, about the laws of physics that\ngovern good storytelling. These are lessons my writing partners and I\nhave learned through the real school of Hollywood hard knocks.\nWe, and hopefu lly you, are in the business of trying to pitch our\nwares to the majors, make a big sale, and appeal to the biggest possible\naudience. We want a hit \u2014 and a sequel if we can! Why play the game\nif you don\u2019t swing for the fence ? And while I love the Indie world, I\nwant to hit it out of the park in the world of the major studios.  That\u2019 s\nwhy this book is primarily for those who want to master the\nmainstream film market.\nNone of these rules, and none of my experiences in screenwritin g,\nwere discovered in a vacuum. I learned from all my writing partners to\nwhom I dedicate this book: How ard Burkons, Jim Haggin, Colby Carr,\nMike Cheda, Tracey Jackson, and Sheldon Bull. I also learned from,\nand owe my career to, my agen ts \u2014 like my beloved Hilary Wayne,\nmy manager Andy Cohen, and many others. I have also been\nenlightened by my seminar students and Web writers, those who grew\nup loving the Indie film world, and who have given me new\nperspectives by questioning me in that snotty-as-hell \u2018tude that only\ninsightful young people have.\nIf my Save the Cat example has whetted your appetite to learn\nmore tricks, then let\u2019s begin. Because it\u2019s one of many that are basic.\nAnd they work.\nEvery time.\nThey\u2019re the rules I hope you will learn and use and even break.\nAnd hopefully when your movie comes out, and it\u2019s satisfying and a\nhit \u2014 you can pass on your rules to others.\nWe\u2019ve all had this experience \u2026\nIt\u2019s Saturday night.\nYou and your friends have decided to see a movie.\nOne of you is picked to read the choices from the newspaper while the\nothers listen and decide. And if you are an aspiring spec screenwriter ,\nyou\u2019re about to learn a very important lesson.\nIf you\u2019ve ever had the honor , if you\u2019ve ever been the one elected to\nread the film choices for a group of gathered friends, congratu lations, you\nhave now had the experience of \u201cpitching\u201d a movie \u2014 just like the pros.\nAnd just like the pros, you have  been faced with the same problem. Yes, the\nfilm stars Geor ge Clooney; sure, it\u2019s got amazing special effects; of course,\nEbert and Roeper give it two thumbs up.\nBut what\u2019 s it about?\nIf you can\u2019t answer that question, you know it pretty quickly . If what\nthe movie is about isn\u2019t clear from the poster and the title, what are you\ngoing to say to describe it? Usually what you\u2019re left with, standing there,\nnewspaper in hand, is telling your friends everything about the movie that\nit\u2019s not. What you heard. What People  Magazi ne said. Some cockeyed re-\ntelling of the plot that the star revealed on Letterman . And odds are that at\nthe end of that rather feeble explanation, your friends will say what\nfilmmakers everywhere fear most: \u201cWhat else is playing?\u201d\nAll because you couldn\u2019 t answer a simple question: \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d is the name of the game. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d is the movie. A\ngood \u201cWhat is it?\u201d is the coin of the realm.\nLet\u2019s CUT T O: Monday morning in Hollywood.\nThe results are in from the week end. The burning wreckage of the big\nbox-of fice disaster is smoking on the front page of Variety . The makers of\nthe surprise hit that stunned everybody are still working the phones saying:\n\u201cI knew  it! I told you so!\u201d And for everyone else the process is starting all\nover again:\n \n> A producer and writer are in some movie executive\u2019 s office\nabout to pitch their \u201cbig idea.\u201d\n> An agent is on the phone describing the script her client wrote\nthat she read over the weekend and loves!\n> An executive is meeting with the studio\u2019 s marketing team trying\nto figure out what the poster should look like for their upcoming\nsummer release.\nEveryone, all across town, in a position to buy or in the effort to sell, is\ntrying to wrap their brains around the same question your friends were\nasking on Saturday night: \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nAnd if they can\u2019 t, they\u2019re toast.\nIf you think this sounds cold, if you can\u2019t believe that Hollywood\ndoesn\u2019 t care about \u201cstory\u201d or the artistic vision of the filmmakers, trust me,\nit\u2019s only going to get worse. It\u2019s because just like you with your newspaper\ntrying to pitch your friends their movie choices, the competition for our\nattention spans has gotten fierce.\nThere are movies, TV, radio, the Internet, and music. There are 300\nchannels of cable; there are magazines; and there are sports. In truth, on any\ngiven weekend,  even an avid moviegoer only has about 30 seconds to\ndecide what to see. And what about those moviegoers who aren\u2019 t so avid?\nHow are you going to cut through all the traffic that\u2019s competing for their\nattention and communicate with them ?\nThere are just too many choices.\nSo the studios try to make it easy to choose. That\u2019 s why they produce\nso many  sequels and remakes. They call them \u201cpre-sold franchi ses\u201d \u2014 and\nget ready to see a lot more of them.\nA pre-sold franchise  is something that a goodly chunk of the audience\nis already \u201csold\u201d on. It cuts way down on the \u201cWhat is it?\u201d factor because\nmost people already kind of know. Some recent examples include Starsky\nand Hutch , The Hulk , and Resident Evil, based on a TV show , a comic\nbook, and a video game respect ively \u2014 and each with a built-in fan base.\nThere\u2019 s also a plague of sequels: Shrek 2, Spider -Man 2, Mission:\nImpossible 3, Ocean\u2019 s Twelve . It\u2019s not that Hollywood is creatively\nbankrupt; the decision-makers just don\u2019t think that you out there with your\nnewspapers every Saturday really , deep down, want to try anything new.\nWhy gamble your 10 bucks on something you\u2019re not sure of versus\nsomething you already know?\nAnd maybe they\u2019re right. If you can\u2019t answer \u201cWhat is it?\u201d why take a\nchance?\nThe problem for us, the spec screenwriters of the world, is that we\ndon\u2019t own any of these pre-sold  franchises nor are we likely to. We\u2019re the\nguys and gals with a laptop computer and a dream. How are we going to\ncome up with something as good as Lawr ence of Arabia  that will sell like\nSpy Kids 3-D ? Well, there is a way. But to try it, I want you to do something\ndaring. I want you to forget all about your screenplay for now, the cool\nscenes that are bursting forth in your imagination, the soundtra ck, and the\nstars you KNOW would be interested in being in it. For get all that.\nAnd concentrate on writing one sentence. One line.\nBecause if you can learn how to tell me \u201cWhat is it?\u201d better , faster , and\nwith more creativity , you\u2019ll keep me interested. And incidentally , by doing\nso before you start writing your script, you\u2019ll make the story better , too.\nTHE LOGLINE FROM HELL\nI talk to lots of screenwriters, I\u2019ve been pitched by experts and\namateurs, and my question when they prematurely drift into the story of\ntheir movie is always the same: \u201cWhat\u2019 s the one-line?\u201d Oddly , this is often\nthe last thing screenwriters think about when writing a script. Believe me,\nI\u2019ve been there. You\u2019re so involved in your scenes, you\u2019re so jazzed about\nbeing able to tie in that symbolic motif from The Odyssey , you\u2019ve got it all\nso mapped out, that you forget one simple thing: You can\u2019t tell me what it\u2019s\nabout. Y ou can\u2019 t get to the heart of the story in less than 10 minutes.\nBoy, are you screwed!\nAnd I personally refuse to listen.\nIt\u2019s because I know the writer hasn\u2019 t thought it through. Not really .\nBecause a good screenwriter , especially anyone writing on spec, has to\nthink about everyone all down the line, from the agent to the producer to the\nstudio head to the public. You won\u2019 t be there to \u201cset the mood,\u201d  so how are\nyou going to get strangers excited? And getting them  excited is Job One. So\nI cut writers off at their FADE IN: because I know everyone else will too. If\nyou can\u2019t tell me about it in one quick line, well, buddy I\u2019m on to\nsomething else. Until you have  your pitch, and it grabs me, don\u2019t bother\nwith the story .\nIn Hollywood parlance it\u2019s called a logline  or a one-line . And the\ndifference betwe en a good one and a bad one is simple. When I pick up the\ntrades and read the logline of a spec or a pitch that\u2019s sold and my first\nreaction is \u201cWhy didn\u2019 t I think of that?!\u201d Well\u2026 that\u2019s a good one. At\nrandom I\u2019m going to select a few recent sales (from my Web source:\nwww .hollywoodlitsales.com ) that made me jealous. They\u2019re in my genre,\nfamily comedy , but what we can learn from them crosses comedy , drama,\nwhatever . Each of these was a big, fat spec sale in the six-to-s even figure\nrange:\nA newly married couple must spend Christmas Day at each of\ntheir four divorced parent\u2019 s homes \u2013 4 Christmases\nA just-hired employee goes on a company weekend and soon\ndiscovers someone\u2019 s trying to kill him \u2013 The Retr eat\nA risk-averse teacher plans on marrying his dream girl but must\nfirst accompany his overprotect ive future brother -in-law \u2014 a cop \u2014\non a ride along from hell! \u2013 Ride Along  (Please note: Anything \u201cfrom\nhell\u201d is always a comedy plus.)\nBelieve it or not, each of these loglines has the same things in\ncommon. Along with answering \u201cWhat is it?\u201d each contains four\ncomponents that make it a sale.\nWhat are those four components?\nWell, let\u2019 s investigate\u2026 the logline fr om hell!\nISN\u2019T IT IRONIC?\nThe number one thing a good logline must have, the single most\nimportant eleme nt, is: irony . My good friend and former writing partner , the\nfunny and fast-typing Colby Carr, pointed this out to me one time and he\u2019s\n100% correct. And that goes for whether it\u2019 s a comedy or a drama.\nA cop comes to L.A. to visit his estranged wife and her office\nbuilding is taken over by terrorists \u2013 Die Har d\nA businessman falls in love with a hooker he hires to be his date\nfor the weekend \u2013 Pretty W oman\nI don\u2019t know about you, but I think both of these loglines, one from a\ndrama, one from a romantic comedy, fairly reek of irony . And irony gets my\nattention. It\u2019s what we who struggle with loglines like to call the hook ,\nbecause that\u2019 s what it does. It hooks  your interest.\nWhat is intriguing about each of the spec sales I\u2019ve cited above is that\nthey, too, have that same ironic touch. A holiday season of supposed family\njoy is turned on its cynical head  in the 4 Christmases  example. What could\nbe more  unexpected (another way to say \u201cironic\u201d) for a new employee,\ninstead of being welcomed to a company , to be faced with a threat on his\nlife during The Retreat? What Colby identified is the fact that a good\nlogline must be emotionally intriguing, like an itch you have  to scratch.\nA logline is like the cover of a book; a good one makes you want to\nopen it, right now, to find out what\u2019 s inside. In identifying the ironic\nelements of your story and putting them into a logline, you may discover\nthat you don\u2019t have that. Well, if you don\u2019t, then there may not only be\nsomething wrong with your logline \u2014 maybe your story\u2019 s off, too. And\nmaybe it\u2019s time to go back and rethink it. Insisting on irony in your logline\nis a good place to find out what\u2019s missing. Maybe you don\u2019t have a good\nmovie yet.\nA COMPELLING MENT AL PICTURE\nThe second most important element that a good logline has is that you\nmust be able to see a whole movie in it. Like Proust\u2019 s madeleine , a good\nlogline, once said, blossoms in your brain. You see the movie, or at least the\npotential for it, and the mental images it creates offer the promise of more.\nOne of my personal favorites is producer David Permut\u2019 s pitch for Blind\nDate : \u201cShe\u2019s the perfect woman \u2014 until she has a drink.\u201d I don\u2019t know\nabout you, but I see it. I see a beautiful girl and a date gone bad and a guy\nwho wants to save it because\u2026 she\u2019s the one! There\u2019 s a lot going on in that\none-line, far more than in the actual movie, but that\u2019s a different subject\naltogether . The point is that a good logline, in addition to pulling you in, has\nto offer the promise of more.\nIn the above examples for new spec script sales, we even see where\neach film begins and ends, don\u2019t we? Although I haven\u2019 t read more than the\none-line for Ride Along , I think this movie will probably take place in one\nnight, like After Hours . That actually goes for each of those examples. All\nthree loglines clearly demarcat e a time frame in which their story takes\nplace: Christmas  Day, the weeke nd of a corporate retreat, and in the case of\nRide Along , a singl e night. In addition, the Ride Along  exampl e offers an\nobvious comic conflict as oppo sites face off over a common goal. It will\ntake a na\u00efve, scaredy-cat teacher  and throw him into the crime-ridden world\nof his brother -in-law , the cop. This is why \u201cfish-out-of-water\u201d stories are so\npopular: You can see the potential fireworks of one type of person being\nthrust into a world outside his ken. In that one set-up line a whole story\nblooms with possibilities.\nDoes your logline offer this? Does giving me the set-up of your\ncomedy or drama make my imagination run wild with where  I think the\nstory will go? If it doesn\u2019 t, you haven\u2019 t got the logline yet. And I\u2019ll say it\nagain: If you don\u2019t have the logline, maybe you should rethink your whole\nmovie .\nAUDIENCE AND COST\nAnother thing a good logline has, that is important in attracting studio\nbuyers, is a built-in sense of who it\u2019 s for and what it\u2019 s going to cost.\nLet\u2019s take 4 Christmases  for example. I\u2019ll bet they\u2019re going after the\nsame audience that Meet The Parents and its sequel Meet the Fockers\nfound. Both of these are medium-cost, four-quadrant pictur es that seek to\nattract the broadest possible audience. From the elements I see inherent in\nthe 4 Christmases  pitch, it\u2019 s what the writers are trying for . They\u2019re going to\nget two twenty-something stars to pull in the core tar get \u2014 young people \u2014\nand they\u2019re going to stunt cast the parents\u2019 roles with stars the older crowd\nlikes. Can we get Jack or Robin or Dustin? Well, sure! Look how well De\nNiro did in Meet The Par ents!\nI also know from the logline that the movie\u2019 s not expensive. Sure there\nmay be a car chase or two and a Christmas tree fire (I\u2019m guessing) but\nbasically it\u2019s a block comedy  \u2014 so called because it takes place\u2026 on the\nblock. There are few \u201ccompany moves\u201d where cast and crew have to travel.\nIt\u2019s cheap. If I\u2019m an executive who\u2019 s looking for a genera l audience,\nmedium budget (depending on the stars) Christmas perennial, this sounds\njust about perfect for my needs . I know what I\u2019m dealing with in terms of\naudience and cost.\nSend it over!\nAnd someone obviously did.\nThat\u2019 s a whole lot to ask from one lousy line of description, don\u2019t you\nthink? But it\u2019 s right there.\nDoes your logline contain that kind of information?\nA KILLER TITLE\nLastly , what is intriguing about a good logline must include the title.\nTitle and logline  are, in fact, the one-two punch, and a good combo never\nfails to knock me out. Like the irony in a good logline, a great title must\nhave irony and tell the tale. One of the best titles of recent memory , and one\nI still marvel at, is Legally Blonde . When I think about all the bad titles it\ncould have been \u2014 Barbie Goes To Harvar d, Totally Law School , Airhead\nAppar ent \u2014 to come up with one that nails the concept, without being so\non the nose  that it\u2019s stupid, is an art unto itself. I am jealous of that title. A\ngood sign!\nMy favorite bad title ever, just to give you an idea of what doesn\u2019 t\nwork for me, is For Love or Money . There\u2019ve been four movies with that\ntitle that I know of, one starring Michael J. Fox, and I can\u2019t tell you the plot\nof any of them. You could probably call every movie ever made For Love\nor Money  and be right \u2014 technically . It just shows how un-daring a gener ic\ntitle can be and how something vague like that kills your interest in paying\n$10 to see it.\nOne of the key ingredients in a good title, however , is that it must  be\nthe headline of the story . Again I cite 4 Christmases  as an example. While\nit\u2019s not a world-beater , it\u2019s not bad. But it does the one thing that a good title\nmust do, and I\u2019ll highlight it because it\u2019 s vital that you get this:\nIt says what it is!\nThey could have called 4 Christmases  something more vague, how\nabout Yuletide ? That says \u201cChristmas,\u201d right? But it doesn\u2019 t pinpoint what\nthis particular Christmas movie is about. It doesn\u2019 t say what it is, which is a\nmovie about one couple spend ing four different Christmase s with four\ndifferent sets of families on the same Christmas day. If it doesn\u2019 t pass the\nSay What It Is Test, you don\u2019t have your title. And you don\u2019t have the one-\ntwo punch that makes a great logline.\nI admit that often I have come up with the title first and made the story\nmatch. That\u2019s how I thought up a script I went on to co-write and sell called\nNuclear Family . At first all I had was the title, then I came up with the\nironic twist. Instead of nuclear as in \u201cfather , mother , and childr en\u201d the way\nthe term is meant, why not nuclear as in \u201cradioactive.\u201d The logline became:\n\u201cA dysfunctional family goes camping on a nuclear dumpsite and wakes up\nthe next morning with super powers.\u201d With the help of my writing partner ,\nthe quick-witted and jet-setting Jim Haggin, we fleshed out that story and\nsold the script in a bidding war to Steven Spielber g for $1 millio n. Our title\nand logline met all the criteria cited above: irony , promise of more,\naudience and cost (four -quadran t, with special effects, not stars), and one\nthat definitely said what it is.\nIt\u2019s a movie I still want to see, if anyone\u2019 s listening.\nYOU AND YOUR \u201cWHA T IS IT?\u201d\nAll good screenwriters are bullheads.\nThere, I said it.\nBut I mean it in a nice way! Because  if there\u2019 s anyone who\nunderstands the occasional arrogance of the screenwriter , it\u2019s moi. To be a\nscreenwriter is to deal with an ongoing tug of war between breathtaking\nmegalomania and insecurity so deep it takes years of therapy just to be able\nto say \u201cI\u2019m a writer\u201d out loud. This is especially so amon g the spec\nscreenwriting crowd I like to hang with. We come up with our movie ideas,\nwe start to \u201ccreate,\u201d we SEE it so clearly , that often by the time we\u2019re\nwriting that sucker , it\u2019s too late to turn back. We\u2019re going to bullhead our\nway through this script no matter what anyone says. But I am suggesting\nthat you say \u201cwhoa\u201d to all that. I\u2019m proposing that before you head off into\nyour FADE IN: you think long and hard about the logline, the title, and the\nposter .\nAnd even do some test marketing.\nWhat\u2019 s that, you ask?\nA TEST MARKETING EXAMPLE\nI have posed the possibility that you hold off on writing your script\nuntil you get a killer logline and title. I know this is painful. But here\u2019 s\nwhere it pays off. I have just been working with a screenwriter  online. He\ndid not have his logline. He did have a good idea \u2014 or at least the start of\none \u2014 but the logline was vague, it didn\u2019 t grab me. I sent him back to the\ndreaded Page One  (an almost total rewrite). He bitched and moaned, but he\ndid it.\nHe put away his story and all the vivid scenes and the recurring  motifs\nand started writing loglines \u2014 an awful, soul-eating chore. He tried to come\nup with ones that were still his story , but which met the criter ia. What he\ndiscovered, after many failed attempts, was that he had to start fudging his\nlogline to get it to have irony , audience and cost, a clear sense of what the\nmovie promised , and a killer title. And when he finally let go of his\npreconceived notions of what his story was \u2014 voila! The logline changed.\nSoon, he started getting better response from people he pitched to, and\nsuddenly , voila!  #2 \u2014 his story started to change to match the logline, and\nvoila! #3 \u2014 the story got better! The irony of what he sort of had was\nbrought into better focus. And when it was put into a pithy logline form, the\nconflicts were brought into sharper focus too. They had to! Or else the\nlogline wouldn\u2019 t work. The characters became more distinct, the story\nbecame more clearly defined, and the logline ultimately made the actual\nwriting easier .\nThe best thing about what this screenwriter discovered is that he saved\neverybody , all down the line, a whole lot of money and troub le. Can you\nimagine trying to do these kinds  of logline fixes during postprod uction? It\u2019s\na little late by then. Before anyone spent a dime, using only paper, pencil,\nand his own wits, he did everyone\u2019 s job for them. He not only made it easier\nfor the guy with the newspaper  to pitch to his friends, but he gave them a\nbetter story once they got to the movie theater . All because he had given his\nproject a better \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nThe other great part about road-testing your logline is that you have\nthe experience of all-weather pitching. I pitch to anyone who will stand\nstill. I do it in line at Starbucks. I do it with friends and strangers. I always\nspill my guts when it comes to discussing what I\u2019m working on, because:\na. I have no fear that anyone will steal my idea (and anyone who\nhas that fear is an amateur) and\u2026\nb. You find out more about your movie by talking to people one-\non-one than having them read it.\nThis is what I mean by \u201ctest marketing.\u201d\nWhen I am about to go pitch a studio, when I am working on a new\nidea for a movie, or when I can\u2019t decide which of four or five ideas is best, I\ntalk to \u201ccivilian s.\u201d I talk to them and I look in their eyes as I\u2019m talking.\nWhen they start to drift, when they look away , I\u2019ve lost them. And I know\nmy pitch has problems. So I make sure that when I pitch to my next victim,\nI\u2019ve corrected whatever slow spot or confusing element I overlooked the\nfirst time out. And most of all, it\u2019 s really fun to do.\nA typical scenario goes like this:\nINT. COFFEE BEAN AND TEA LEAF \u2013 SUNSET PLAZA \u2013\nDAY A m\u00e9lange of starlets, weekend Hell\u2019 s Angels, and Eurotrash\nsnobs sip double mocha frappes. Blake Snyder eyes the crowd. He\napproaches the person who seems least likely to hit him.\nBLAKE SNYDER\nHi, could you help me?\nSTRANGER\n(dubious)\nWhat is it? I have a Pilates class in ten minutes.\nBLAKE SNYDER\nPerfect, this will only take a second. I\u2019m working on a movie idea\nand I wanted to know what you think.\nSTRANGER\n(smiling, looks at watch)\nOkay\u2026\nThis, to me, is the perfect set-up and one that I repeat with all age\ngroups, in all kinds of situations, all over Southern Califor nia \u2014 but\nespecially with the tar get audience of whatever I\u2019m working on.\nThis kind of test marketing is not only a great way to meet people, it\u2019s\nthe only way to know what you\u2019ve got. And a \u201cpitchee\u201d who is thinking\nabout being somewhere else is the perfect subject. If you can get his\nattention, if you can keep his atten tion, and if he wants to know more about\nthe story you\u2019re telling, you\u2019ve really got a good movie idea.\nWhat you\u2019ll also find by gettin g out from behind your computer and\ntalking to peopl e is how that true-life experience that happened to you in\nsummer camp in 1972, the story that you are basing your entire  screenplay\non that means so much to you, means nothing to a stranger . To get and keep\nthat stranger \u2019s attention, you\u2019re going to have to figure out a way to present\na compelling \u201cWhat is it?\u201d that does mean something to him. Or you\u2019re\ngoing to be wasting your time. There are a lot more strangers than friends\nbuying tickets to movies. No matter who is encouraging you on the friend\nside of your life, it\u2019 s the strangers you really need to impress.\nWhat better way to find out what you\u2019ve got than to actually go out\nand ask?\nTHE \u201cDEA TH\u201d OF HIGH CONCEPT\nAll of the above  dances around a term that many people in Hollywood\nhate: high concept . The term was made famous by Jeffrey Katzenber g and\nMichael Eisner in their heyday as young gurus running Disney . To them it\nmeant just what  we\u2019ve been discussing here \u2014 making the movie easier to\nsee \u2014 and they came up with a long run of successful high conc ept movies.\nAll you had to do was look at the one-sheet  (another name for the poster)\nand you knew \u201cWhat is it?\u201d for Ruthless People , Outrageous Fortune , and\nDown and Out in Beverly Hills . Like most fashionable terms it\u2019s now out to\nsay your project is high concept. The death of high concept has been\nproclaimed many times. But like a lot of what I\u2019m going to discuss\nthroughout this book, I care less about what is au currant  and more about\nwhat works and what is simple common sense.\nIn my opinion, thinking \u201chigh concept,\u201d thinking about \u201cWhat is it?\u201d is\njust good manners, common courtesy if you will. It\u2019s a way to put yourself\nin the shoes of the customer , the person who\u2019 s paying good money ,\nincluding parkin g and a babysit ter, to come and see your film. And don\u2019t\nkid yourself, as brilliant as these two visionaries are, Michael  Eisner and\nJeffrey Katzenber g didn\u2019 t inven t high concept, it\u2019s been around from the\nbeginning.\nThink about every Preston Sturges movie hit from the 1940s \u2014\nChristmas In July, Hail the Conqu ering Hero, Lady Eve, even Sullivan\u2019 s\nTravels  \u2014 all high concept ideas that drew people into theatres based on the\nlogline and poster .\nThink about every Alfred Hitchcock thriller ever made \u2014 Rear\nWindow , North by Northwest , Vertigo  and Psycho .\nJust mentioning these movies to a true fan evokes the pitch and the\nposter of each story. And check out those titles. All of them, across the\nboard, certainly say what it is and they do so in a way that\u2019s not on the nose\nor stupid (well, Psycho  is potentially lame, but we\u2019ll let him off the hook on\nthat one \u2014 it\u2019 s Hitchcock, after all).\nThe point is that if someone gives you static about your high concept\nidea, just smile and know that clearly and creatively presenting a better\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d to a potential audience \u2014 no matter who they are or what\nposition they occupy in the chain \u2014 never goes out of fashion. I defy those\nwho think this is a game for salesmen and not filmmakers to come up with a\nbetter title than Legally Blonde . And as we will see in the next chapter ,\nwe\u2019re only at the beginning of finding ways to put yourself in the shoes of\nthe moviegoer .\nAnd that is what we should all be doing more of.\nSUMMAR Y\nSo are your synapses starting to misfire? Are the growing pains too\nmuch? Well, whether this is old news or new news, the \u201cWhat is it?\u201d is the\nonly place to begin this task of ours. The job of the screenwriter , especially\none writing on spec, must inclu de consideration for everyone all along the\nway, from agent to producer to the studio exec who decides what gets made.\nAnd that job starts with that question: \u201cWhat is it?\u201d\nAlong with a good \u201cWhat is it?\u201d a movie must have a clear sense of\nwhat it\u2019s about and who it\u2019s for. Its tone, potential, the dilemma of its\ncharacters, and the type of characters they are, should be easy to understand\nand compelling.\nIn order  to better create a good \u201cWhat is it?\u201d the spec screenwriter\nmust be able to tell a good one-line or logline \u2014 a one- or two-sentence\ngrabber that tells us everything . It must satisfy four basic elements to be\neffective:\n \n1. Irony . It must be in some way ironic and emotionally involvin g\n\u2014 a dramatic situation that is like an itch you have to scratch.\n2. A comp elling mental picture. It must bloom in your mind when\nyou hear it. A whole movie must be implied, often including a time\nframe.\n3. Audience and cost. It must demarcate the tone, the target\naudience, and the sense of cost, so buyers will know if it can make a\nprofit.\n4. A killer title. The one-two punch of a good logline must include  a\ngreat title, one that \u201csays what it is\u201d and does so in a clever way .\nThis is all part of what is called \u201chigh concept,\u201d a term that came  about\nto describe movies that are easy to see. In fact, high concept is more\nimportant than ever before, especially since movies must be sold\ninternationally , too. Domestic box office used to account for 60% of a\nmovie\u2019 s overall profit, but that figure is down to 40%. That means movies\nmust travel and be understood everywher e \u2014 over half of your market is\nnow outside the U.S. So while high concept is a term that\u2019s not fashionable,\nit\u2019s a type of movie all Hollywood is actively looking for. You just have to\nfigure out a quicker , slicker way to provide high concept ideas.\nFinally , this is all about intriguing the audience, so a good way to road\ntest an idea is to get out from behind your computer and pitch it. Pitch your\nmovie to anyone who will listen and adjust accordingly . You never know\nwhat valuable information you can learn from a stranger with a blank\nexpression.\nEXERCISES\n \n1. Pick up the newspaper and pitch this week\u2019 s movie choices to a\nfriend. Can you think of ways to improve the movie\u2019 s logline or\nposter?\n2. If you are already working on a screenplay , or if you have several\nin your files, write the loglines for each and present them to a stranger .\nBy pitch ing in this way, do you find the logline changing? Does it\nmake you think  of things you should have tried in your script? Does\nthe story have to change to fit the pitch?\n3. Grab a TV Guide  and read the loglines from the movie section.\nDoes the logline  and title of a movie say what it is? Do vague loglines\nequate with a movie\u2019 s failure in your mind? Was its lack of a good\n\u201cWhat is it?\u201d responsible in any way for that failure?\n4. If you don\u2019t have an idea for a screenplay yet, try these five\ngames to jump-start your movie idea skills:\n1. GAME #1a: Funny _________\nPick a drama, thriller , or horror film and turn it into a comedy .\nExample: Funny Christine  \u2014 The haunted dream car of a teenage\nboy that ruins his life now becomes a comedy when the car starts\ngiving dating advice.\n2. GAME #1b: Serious _________\nLikewise, pick a comedy and make it into a drama. Serio us\nAnimal House  \u2014 Drama about cheating scandal at a small\nuniversity ends in A Few Good Men -like showdown.\n3. GAME #2: FBI out of water\nThis works for comedy or drama. Name five places that a FBI\nagent in the movies has never been sent to solve a crime.\nExample: \u201cStop or I\u2019ll Baste!\u201d: Slob FBI agent is sent undercover\nto a Provence Cooking School.\n4. GAME #3: School\nWorks for both drama and comedy. Name five examples of an\nunusual type of school, camp, or classroom. Example: \u201cWife\nSchool\u201d: W omen sent by their rich husbands soon rebel.\n5. GAME #4: VERSUS!!!\nDrama or comedy . Name severa l pairs of people to be on opposite\nsides of a burning issue. Example: A hooker and a preacher fall in\nlove when a new massage parlor divides the residents of a small\ntown.\n6. GAME #5: My Is A Serial Killer\nDrama or comedy . Name an unusual person, animal, or thing that\na paranoid can suspect of being a murderer . Example: \u201cMy Boss\nIs A Serial Killer.\u201d Guy gets promoted every time a dead body\nturns up at the corporation \u2014 is the murderer his employer?\nAnd if you come up with a really good logline for a family comedy ,\nhere is my e-mail address: bsnyder264@aol.com . I\u2019d be happy to hear a\ngood one\u2026 if you think you\u2019ve got it.\nA screenwriter \u2019s daily conundrum is how to avoid clich\u00e9.\nYou can be near the clich\u00e9, you can dance around it, you can run right\nup to it and almost  embrace it.\nBut at the last second you must turn away .\nYou must give it a twist.\nAnd insisting on those twists, defying that inner voice that says \u201cOh,\nwell, no one will notice,\u201d is a universal struggle that good storytellers have\nbeen fighting forever .\nTo quote  the studio executive who first blurted out this rule to me, Sam\nGoldwyn-like, during a development meeting: \u201cGive me the same thing\u2026\nonly dif ferent!\u201d\nBless his pointy little head.\nIn every aspect of creation \u2014 from the idea, to the way characters\nspeak, to the scenes themselves \u2014 putting a fresh spin on it (whatever \u201cit\u201d\nis) is what we do every day. But to know how to avoid the clich\u00e9, to know\nwhat tradition you are pushing  forward, begins with knowing what that\ntradition is. A full-fledged knowledge of hundreds of movies, and\nespecially those which your movie is like, is required.\nYet surprising as it seems for people who are interested in pursuing a\ncareer in movies, I am shocked  \u2014 shocked!  \u2014 to find how many up-and-\ncomers can not even quote from movies in their own genre, much less\nmovies generally .\nTrust me, all the big guys can.\nListen to Spielbe rg or Scorsese talk about movies. They know and can\nquote from hundreds. And I don\u2019t mean quote as in \u201crecite lines from,\u201d I\nmean quote as in \u201cexplain how each movie works.\u201d Movies are intricately\nmade emotion machines. They are Swiss watches of precise gears and\nspinning wheels that make them tick. You have to be able to take them apart\nand put them back together again. In the dark. In your sleep . And your\nknowledge of a few movies you like is not enough. It is also not enough to\nknow all the movies of the past five years. You have to go back, see the\nlineage of many types of movies, know what movie begat what in the line\nof succession, and how the art was advanced by each.\nWhich leads me to the subject of genre.\nYou are about to embark on the next step of writing a successful\nscreenplay and that is the categorizing of your movie idea. But no! you\nthink. My movie is new! It\u2019s like nothing ever seen befor e! I will not be put\ninto a category!\nSorry . Too late.\nYou can\u2019t tell me any idea that isn\u2019t like one, or dozens, found  in the\nmovie canon. Trust me, your movie falls into a category . And that category\nhas rules that you need to know . Because to explode the clich\u00e9s, to give us\nthe same thing\u2026 only different , you have to know what genre your movie\nis part of, and how to invent the twists that avoid pat elements. If you can\ndo that, you have a better chanc e to sell. And, by the way, everyone, and I\nmean everyone  in Hollywood, already does this. So why not know what\nthey know?\nWHA T IS IT\u2026 MOST LIKE?\nSo now you\u2019ve got your logline.\nYou\u2019ve followed  my advice, you\u2019ve gone out and test pitche d your\ndozen or so \u201cvictims,\u201d you\u2019ve got their responses and adjusted accordingly ,\nand now your one-liner is just shining there so brightly! You know you\u2019ve\ngot yourself a winner .\nYou\u2019re ready to type F ADE IN: \u2014 right?\nWrong.\nI\u2019m holding you back because before you start writing I want you to\nthink a little bit about the question after \u201cWhat is it?\u201d \u2014 and that\u2019s \u201cWhat is\nit\u2026 most like? \u201d\nI return again to the example of you and your friends on Saturday\nnight. You\u2019ve pitched them their movie choices, and they\u2019ve picked a\ncouple. And now they want to know more about what they can expect to see\nwhen they plunk down their $10. Okay , so it\u2019 s a comedy . But what kind?\nThis situation is why you hear so many bad movie pitches in\nHollywood. They\u2019re the ones, I admit, that I\u2019ve used as shorthand, but\nwhich I really hate and don\u2019t advise you to use. These are the types of\npitches people make fun of \u2014 and rightly so. \u201cIt\u2019s X-Men  meets\nCannonball Run!\u201d the nervous pitcher will say. Or \u201cIt\u2019s Die Hard in a\nbowling alley!\u201d The ones that combine two or more movies are especially\nirksome. You sit there, trying  to imagine how \u201cIt\u2019s Heathers  meets\nM*A*S*H \u201d really works. What is that? Spoiled teenage girls join the\nArmy? A medical team is airlif ted to a high school to save kids who are\nshooting each other? What? And odds are all the pitcher is doing is\ngrabbing two hit movies and hoping there\u2019 s some element in there that\nsomeone will like.\n(PLEASE NOTE : You never use bombs to describe these mad doctor\nexperiments; it\u2019s never \u201cIshtar  meets Howar d the Duck \u201d \u2014 an example\nwhich tells you exactly how bad a technique this is.)\nAnd yet\u2026 I admit I do it.\nThe reason categorizing your movie is a good idea is that it\u2019 s important\nfor you, the screenwriter , to know what type of movie you\u2019re writing. Of\nthe many ways to get lost while in the middle of writing a screen play, this is\nthe most common. When I am writing a movie, when Steven Spielber g is\nwriting a movie, referencing other movies, looking for clues of plotting and\ncharacter within  the genre, is commonplace. And thus, when you are stuck\nin your story or when you\u2019re preparing to write, you will \u201cscreen\u201d a dozen\nmovies that are like the one you\u2019re working on to get clues about why\ncertain plot elem ents are important, why they work or don\u2019t, and where you\ncan change the clich\u00e9 into something fresh.\nThere are 10 movie genres that have proven to be good places to start\nthis process. That\u2019s all they are, a place to start \u2014 we\u2019ll get into how to\nmove past them next.\nAs I search for matches in this game of genre gin rummy \u2014 do I look\nfor runs or pairs ? \u2014 I\u2019m interested in creating categories of movies that I\ncan add more movies to every year. And I think within these 10 story types,\nyou can stick just about every motion picture ever made. You can make up\nyour own catego ries, you can add others to this list, but I hope you won\u2019 t\nneed to. You will also note that nowhere in this list do I have standard genre\ntypes, such as Romantic Comedy , Epic, or Biography \u2014 because those\nnames don\u2019t really tell me anyth ing about what the story is. And that\u2019s what\nI need to know .\nThe 10 types of movies I have categorized here are:\nMonster in the House  \u2013 Of which Jaws , Tremors , Alien , The Exor cist,\nFatal Attraction , and Panic Room  are examples.\nGolden Fleece  \u2013 This is the category of movie best exemplified by\nStar W ars; The Wizard of Oz; Planes, Trains and Automobiles ; Back To The\nFutur e; and most \u201cheist movies.\u201d\nOut of the Bottle  \u2013 This incorpo rates films like Liar, Liar; Bruce\nAlmighty ; Love Potion #9; Freaky Friday ; Flubber ; and even my own little\nkid hit from Disney , Blank Check .\nDude with a Problem  \u2013 This is a genre that ranges in style, tone, and\nemotional substance from Breakdown  and Die Hard to Titanic  and\nSchindler \u2019s List .\nRites Of Passage  \u2013 Every change-of-life story from 10 to Ordinary\nPeople  to Days of W ine and Roses  makes this category .\nBuddy Love  \u2013 This genre is about more  than the buddy movie\ndynamic as seen in cop buddy pictures, Dumb & Dumber , and Rain Man  \u2014\nbut also every love story ever made!\nWhydunit  \u2013 Who cares who, it\u2019s why that counts. Includes Chinatown ,\nChina Syndr ome, JFK, and The Insider .\nThe Fool Triumphant  \u2013 One of the oldest story types, this category\nincludes Being There, Forrest Gump , Dave , The Jerk, Amadeus , and the\nwork of silent clowns like Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd.\nInstitutionalized  \u2013 Just like it sounds, this is about groups: Animal\nHouse , M*A*S*H , One Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019 s Nest, and \u201cfamily\u201d sagas\nsuch as American Beauty  and The Godfather .\nSuperher o \u2013 This isn\u2019t just about the obvious tales you\u2019d think of, like\nSuperman  and Batman , but also includes Dracula , Frankenstein , even\nGladiator  and A Beautiful Mind .\nAre you thoroughly confused? Do you doubt my sanity when I tell you\nthat Schindler \u2019s List and Die Hard are in the same category? Are you\nlooking at me kinda funny when I tell you that buddy movies are just love\nstories in disguis e? Good! Then let\u2019s dig further into the wonderful world of\ngenre.\nMONSTER IN THE HOUSE\nWhat do Jaws , The Exor cist, and Alien  have in common? They\u2019re\nexamples of the genre I call \u201cMonster in the House.\u201d This genre has a long\ntrack record and was probably the first tale Man ever told. It has two\nworking parts: A monster . A house. And when you add people into that\nhouse, desperate to kill the monster , you\u2019ve got a movie type so primal that\nit translates to everyone, everyw here. It\u2019s the type of movie that I like to\nsay, \u201cYou can pitch to a caveman.\u201d It\u2019s not about being dumb, it\u2019s about\nbeing primal . And everyone  underst ands the simple, primal commandment:\nDon\u2019 t\u2026 Get\u2026 Eaten!\nThat\u2019 s why this genre is respon sible for so many worldwide hits and\nfranchises. Y ou can probably run most of these films without the soundtrack\nand still \u201cget it.\u201d Jurassic Park ; the Nightmar e On Elm Street, Friday the\n13th, and Scream series; Tremors  and its sequels; and every haunted house\nand ghost story ever told are all examples of this genre. Even films without\nsupernatural elements, like Fatal Attraction  (starrin g Glenn Close as the\n\u201cMonster\u201d), fall into this category . And it\u2019s clear from such movies as\nArachnophobia , Lake Placid , and Deep Blue Sea, if you don\u2019t know the\nrules of Monster in the House \u2014 you fail.\nThe rules, to me, are simple. The \u201chouse\u201d must be a confined space: a\nbeach town, a spaceship, a futuristic Disneyland with dinosau rs, a family\nunit. There must  be sin committ ed \u2014 usually greed (monetary or carnal) \u2014\nprompting the creation of a supernatural monster that comes like an\navenging angel to kill those who have committed that sin and spare those\nwho realize what that sin is. The rest is \u201crun and hide.\u201d And putting a new\ntwist on both the monster , the monster \u2019s powers, and the way we say\n\u201cBoo!\u201d is the job of the screenwriter who wants to add to the illustrious\nlimb of this family tree of movies.\nWe can see a bad example of this category in Arachnophobia , the film\nstarring Jeff Daniels and John Goodman. Bad monster: a little spider . Not\nmuch supernatu ral there. Not all that scary either \u2014 you step on it and it\ndies. Also: No house! At any given moment, the residents of\nArachnophobia  can say \u201cCheck please\u201d and be on the next Greyhound out\nof town.\nWhere is the tension there?\nBecause the filmmakers behind Arachnophobia  violated the rules of\nMonster in the House, they wound up with a mishmash. Is it a comedy or a\ndrama? Are we really supposed  to be scared-scared? I could write a whole\nbook on the rules of Monster in the House, but you don\u2019t need me to have a\nMITH film festival in your own home and discover these nuances for\nyourself. And if you\u2019re writing a screenplay that falls into this genre, I\nsuggest you do just that.\nI want to make clear that, as with all the genres to be discussed here,\nthis is a category that has not, repeat not, been exhausted. There is always a\nway to do a new one. But you must give it a fresh twist to be successful.\nYou must break  from clich\u00e9. You must \u201cGive us the same thing\u2026 only\ndifferent.\u201d Anyo ne who thinks there isn\u2019t new territory to mine in the\nMonster in the House genre, should think of the myth of the Minotaur .\nGreat Monster: a half-man/ha lf-bull. Great house: a maze where the\ncondemned are sent to die. But the ancient Greek hack who eyed this\nsuccessful story and said: \u201cIt\u2019s over. Genre\u2019 s dead. I can\u2019t top that!\u201d never\nenvisioned Glenn Close with a bad perm and a boiled rabbit.\nTHE GOLDEN FLEECE\nThe quest myth has been one of the more winning tales told around the\ncampfire since, well, forever . And if your screenplay can in any way be\ncategorized as a \u201cRoad Movie,\u201d  then you must know the rules of a genre I\ncall \u201cThe Golden Fleece.\u201d The name comes from the myth of Jason and the\nArgonauts and yet it\u2019s always about the same thing: A hero goes \u201con the\nroad\u201d in search of one thing and winds up discovering something else \u2014\nhimself. Thus Wizard Of Oz; Planes, Train and Automobiles ; Star Wars;\nRoad T rip; and Back to the Futur e are all basically the same movie.\nScary , huh?\nLike the twists of any story , the milestones of The Golden Fleece are\nthe peop le and incidents that our hero or heroes encounter along the way.\nBecause it\u2019s episodic it seems to not be connected, but it must be. The\ntheme of every Golden Fleece movie is internal growth; how the incidents\naffect the hero is, in fact, the plot. It is the way we know that we are truly\nmaking forward progress \u2014 it\u2019s not the mileage we\u2019re racking up that\nmakes a good Golden Fleece, it\u2019s the way the hero changes as he goes. And\nforcing those milestones to mean something to the hero is your job.\nAs it turns out, I have been working on a Golden Fleece with my\ncurrent writing partner , the amazingly successful and talented Sheldon Bull.\nAnd we have been discussing Golden Fleece movies a lot \u2014 naturally .\nSince our film is a comedy , we\u2019ve looked at Planes, Trains and\nAutomobiles , and discussed the character dynamics of Rain Man, Road\nTrip, and even Animal House , believe  it or not, in an effort to get a handle\non what is basic ally the story of a kid who heads home after being unjustly\nkicked out of military school and discovers\u2026 that his parents have moved\nwithout telling him! It\u2019s basically \u201cHome Alone  on the road.\u201d (Sorry! It\u2019s a\nbad habit). The adjustments we are making aren\u2019 t about the adventure \u2014\nwhich I find hilarious \u2014 but about what each incident means to our kid\nhero. In many ways what these adventures are is irrelevant. Whatever fun\nset pieces  our hero encou nters must be shaded to deliver milestones of\ngrowth for our kid lead. We always come back to that Golden Fleece truism\nthat can be found in The Odyssey , Gulliver \u2019s Travels , and any number of\nsuccessful road stories through the ages: It\u2019s not the incidents, it\u2019s what the\nhero learns about himself from those incidents that makes the story work.\nThis genre is also where all heist movies are found. Any quest,\nmission, or \u201ctreasure locked in a castle\u201d that is to be approached by an\nindividual or a group falls into the Golden Fleece category and has the same\nrules. Very often the mission becomes secondary to other , more personal,\ndiscoveries; the twists and turns  of the plot are suddenly less important than\nthe meaning derived from the heist, as Ocean\u2019 s Eleven , The Dirty Dozen ,\nand The Magnificent Seven  prove.\nOUT OF THE BOTTLE\n\u201cI wish I had my own money!\u201d This is what our character Preston\nWaters states in the movie Colby Carr and I wrote and sold to Disney that\nbecame a kid\u2019s mini-hit called Blank Check . And Preston will, in fact, soon\nget his own money \u2014 a million  dollars to be exact \u2014 with which he will\nhappily run amok. This type of wish-fulfillment is so common because it\u2019 s a\nbig part of the human psyche. \u201cI wish I had a _________\u201d is probably the\nsingle most frequently spoken prayer since Adam. And stories that tell a\ngood \u201cwhat if\u201d tale that exploit s these wish fulfillment fantasies are good,\nprimal, easy-for -a-caveman-to-u nderstand stories \u2014 which is why they\u2019re\nso many of them. And why they\u2019re so successful.\nThe comedy hit Bruce Almighty  is an example of this genre. In fact,\nthe flexible Jim Carrey has also been the star of another \u201cOut of the Bottle\u201d\nclassic, The Mask . It doesn\u2019 t have to be God who bestows the magic. It can\nbe a thing \u2014 like The Mask  or a magic VW named \u201cHerbie\u201d in Disney\u2019 s\nThe Love Bug, or a formula that you invent to make the opposite sex fall in\nlove with you as in Love Potion #9 starring Sandra Bullock, or magic silly-\nputty that can save your teaching career as in Flubber  starring Robin\nWilliams.\nThe name Out of the Bottle should evoke the image of a genie who is\nsummoned out of the bottle to grant his master \u2019s wish, but it doesn\u2019 t have to\nbe magi c to be part of this wish -fulfillment genre. In Blank Check , there is\nno magic that gets Preston his million bucks \u2014 sure it\u2019s a long shot, and\nColby and I went out of our way to make it seem reality-ba sed. But it\ndoesn\u2019 t matter . Whether it\u2019s by divine intervention or luck or a magic being\nwho enters the scene, it\u2019 s the same device. For some reason or other , usually\nbecause we like the guy or gal and think they deserve it, their wish is\ngranted and their lives begin to change.\nOn the flip side of Out of the Bottle, but very much the same category ,\nis the curse aspect of wishing. These are comeuppance tales. Another Jim\nCarrey movie, Liar, Liar, is a good example (hmmm, are we seeing a\npattern here about what stars consistently fit best into what Jungian\narchetypes?). Same set-up, same device \u2014 a kid wishes his lying lawyer\nfather would start telling nothing but the truth \u2014 and lo! It happens.\nSuddenly Jim Carrey can\u2019t tell a lie \u2014 on the day of a big case in which\nlying is, and has been, his best weapon. Jim\u2019s going to have to change his\nways and grow if he is to survive, and by doing so, he gets what he really\nwants in the first place: the respect of his wife and son. Another\ncomeuppance tale is Freaky Friday , both the Jodie Foster version and the\nupdated Lindsay Lohan take. But there are many of these, such as All Of Me\nwith Steve Martin and Groundhog Day starring another famous wise guy,\nBill Murray .\nThe rules of Out of the Bottle then are this: If it\u2019s a wish-fulf illment\ntale, the hero must be a put-upon Cinderella who is so under the thumb of\nthose around him that we are really rooting for anyone, or anything, to get\nhim a little happiness. And yet, so the rules tell us and human nature\ndictates, we don\u2019t want to see anyone, even the most underdo g character ,\nsucceed for too long. And eventually , the hero must learn that magic isn\u2019t\neverything, it\u2019s better to be just like us \u2014 us members of the audience \u2014\nbecause in the end we know this will never happen to us. Thus a lesson\nmust be in the of fing; a good moral must be included at the end.\nIf it\u2019s a comeu ppance tale version of Out of the Bottle, then the\nopposite set-up is applied. Here\u2019 s a guy or gal who needs a swift kick in the\nbehind. And yet, there must be something redeemable about them. This is a\nlittle trickier to pull off and must include a Save the Cat scene at the outset,\none where we know that even though this guy or gal is a jerk, there is\nsomething in them that\u2019s worth saving. So in the course of the tale, they get\nthe benefit of the magic (even though it\u2019s a curse); and in the end, they\ntriumph.\nDUDE WITH A PROBLEM\nThis genre is defined by the phrase: \u201cAn ordinary guy finds himself in\nextraordinary circumstances.\u201d And when you think about it, it\u2019s another of\nthe most popular , most primal situations we can imagine for ourselves. All\nof us consider ourselves to be an ordinary guy or gal, and thus we are drawn\ninto sympathetic alignment with the hero of this type of tale from the get-\ngo. Into this \u201cjust an ordinary day\u201d beginning comes something\nextraordinary \u2014 my wife\u2019 s building is taken over by terrorists with\nponytails (Die Hard); Nazis start hauling away my Jewish friends\n(Schindler \u2019s List ); a robot from the future (with an accent!) comes and tells\nme he is here to kill me and my unborn child (The Terminator ); the ship in\nwhich we are traveling hits an iceber g and begins to sink without enough\nlifeboats for everyone on board ( Titanic ).\nThese, my friends, are problems. Big, primal  problems.\nSo how are you, the ordinary guy , going to handle them?\nLike Monster in the House, this genre also has two very simple\nworking parts: a dude, meaning  an average guy or gal just like ourselves.\nAnd a problem: something that this average guy must dig deep inside\nhimself to conquer . From these simple components, an infinite number of\nmix-and-match situations can bloom and grow . The more average the guy,\nthe bigger the challenge, as movies like Breakdown  with Kurt Russell\ndemonstrate.\nIn Breakdown , Kurt has no super powers or skills, no police training.\nNada. But he shares with Die Hard\u2019s Bruce Willis the same domestic\nagenda all average guys unders tand: Save the wife that he loves! Whether\nour hero is skilled or not, it\u2019s the relative size of the challenge  that makes\nthese stories work. And one rule of thumb is: The badder the bad guy, the\ngreater the heroics. So make the bad guy as bad as possible \u2014 always! \u2014\nfor the bigger the problem, the greater the odds for our dude to overcome.\nAnd no matter who the bad guy is, the dude triumphs from his willingness\nto use his indiv iduality to outsmart the far more powerful forces aligned\nagainst him.\nRITES OF P ASSAGE\nRemember the time you were awkwardly going through puberty and\nthat cute girl you had a crush on didn\u2019 t know you were alive?  Remember\nthat birth day party when you turned 40 and your husband came  to you and\nasked for a divorce? These painful examples of life transition resonate with\nus because we have all, to a greater or lesser degree, gone through them.\nAnd growing-pain stories registe r because they are the most sensitive times\nin our lives. It\u2019s what makes us human, and what makes for excellent,\npoignant, and even hilarious storytelling. (Isn\u2019t Dudley Moore in 10 the\nfunniest mid-life crisis put on film?) But whether it\u2019s drama or comedy ,\n\u201cRites of Passage\u201d tales are of a type. And all have the same rules.\nAll movies are about change, so to say that Rites of Passage stories\ndocument a change is missing  the point. These are tales of pain and\ntorment, but usually from an outside force: Life. Sure it\u2019s about the choices\nwe\u2019ve made, but the \u201cmonster\u201d attacking us is often unseen, vague, or one\nwhich we can\u2019t get a handle on simply because we can\u2019t name it. Lost\nWeekend , Days of Wine and Roses , 28 Days  starring Sandra Bullock, and\nWhen A Man Loves A Woman  starring Meg Ryan all tell stories about\ncoming to grips with drugs and alcohol. Likewise, puberty , mid-life crisis,\nold age, romantic break-up, and \u201cgrieving\u201d stories, like those about getting\nover the death of a loved one, such as Ordinary People , also have the same\nthing in common: In a good Rites of Passage tale, everybody\u2019 s in on \u201cthe\njoke\u201d except the person who\u2019 s going through it \u2014 the story\u2019 s hero. And\nonly the experience can of fer a solution.\nIn essence, whether the take is comedic or dramatic, the monster\nsneaks up on the beleaguered  hero and the story is that hero\u2019 s slow\nrealization of who and what that monster is. In the end, these tales are about\nsurrendering, the victory won by giving up to forces stronger than\nourselves. The end point is acceptance of our humanity and the moral of the\nstory is always the same: That\u2019 s Life!  (another Blake Edwards movie!\nHmmm, betwee n that, 10, and Days of Wine and Roses , Blake Edwards\nappears to like and do well in this genre.)\nIf your movie idea can in any way be considered a Rites of Passage\ntale, then these films are fair game for screening. Like the steps of\nacceptance outlined in Elizabet h K\u00fcbler -Ross\u2019 s On Death and Dying , the\nstructure of this story type is charted in the hero\u2019 s grudging acceptance of\nthe forces of nature that he cannot control or comprehend, and the victory\ncomes with the hero\u2019 s ability to ultimately smile.\nBUDDY LOVE\nThe classic \u201cbuddy story\u201d is a type that I think of as a creation  of the\nMovie Age. Though there were a few great buddy tales (Don Quixote , for\nexample), this category really didn\u2019t take off as a story form until the dawn\nof cinema. My theory is that the buddy movie was invented by a\nscreenwriter who realized that his hero had no one to react to. There was\njust this big, empty space where interior monologue and description is\nfound in fiction. And the screen writer suddenly thought \u201cwhat if\u201d his hero\nhad someone to debate importan t story issues with? Thus the classic \u201cbuddy\nmovie\u201d was born, and from Laurel and Hardy to Bob Hope and Bing\nCrosby to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid to the antics of Wayne\u2019 s\nWorld (both 1 & 2), it has become a movie staple. Two guys talking to each\nother like 48 Hours ; two girls talking to each other like Thelma & Louise ;\ntwo fish talking to each other like Finding Nemo  \u2014 they all work because\nstories of \u201cme and my best friend\u201d will always resonate. Again, they\u2019re very\nhuman and based on universal circumstances. These are stories you can\npitch to a cavem an and both he (and his buddy!) will get it. The secret of a\ngood buddy movie is that it is actually a love story in disguise. And,\nlikewise, all love stories are just buddy movies with the potential for sex.\nBringing Up Baby , Pat and Mike , Woman of the Year, Two Weeks Notice ,\nHow to Lose a Guy in 10 Days  are \u2014 genre-wise \u2014 just sophisticated\nLaur el and Hardy movies where one of the buddies is wearing a skirt. And\nyet the rules for these, drama or comedy , sex or no sex, are the same. At\nfirst the \u201cbuddie s\u201d hate each other . (Where would they have to go if they\ndidn\u2019 t?) But their adventure together brings out the fact that they need each\nother; they are, in essence, incomplete halves of a whole. And realizing this\nleads to even more conflict. Who can tolerate needing  anybody?\nPenultimately , the All Is Lost moment (more on this in Chapter Four)\nwhich occurs toward the end of each of these stories is: separation, a fight, a\ngoodbye-and-good-riddance! that is, in reality , none of these. It\u2019s just two\npeople who can\u2019t stand the fact that they don\u2019t live as well without each\nother , who will have to surrend er their egos to win. And when the final\ncurtain comes down, they have done just that.\nOften, as in Rain Man, one of the buddies is the story\u2019 s hero and will\ndo all or most of the changing (i.e., Tom Cruise) while the other  buddy acts\nas a catalyst of that change and will do slight or no changing (i.e., Dustin\nHoffman). I have been in many story discussions about this dynamic.\nWhose story is it?? is what it very often boils down to. Lethal Weapon  is\nlike that to an extent. It\u2019s Danny Glover \u2019s story . Mel Gibson is the agent of\nchange. And though Mel will not be suicidal by the story\u2019 s end, it\u2019s Danny\nGlover whose transformation we care most about. These \u201ccatalyst\u201d Buddy\nLove tales, in which a \u201cbeing\u201d comes into one\u2019 s life, af fects it, and leaves, is\na subset of the Buddy Love dynamic and an important one to keep in mind.\nMany \u201cboy and his dog\u201d tales are like this, including E.T.\nIf you\u2019re writing a buddy movie or love story , either drama or comedy ,\nthe dyna mics of the Buddy Love structure are a must to know . Sit down\nwith a dozen of these, pop \u2019em into your DVD player , and get ready to be\namazed by how similar they all are. Is this stealing? Is Sandra Bullock\nripping off Katherine Hepburn? Should Cary Grant\u2019 s estate sue Hugh Grant\nfor copyright infringement? Of course not. It\u2019s just good storytelling. And\nthe beats are the same for a reason.\nBecause they always work.\nWHYDUNIT\nWe all know that evil lurks in the hearts of men. Greed happens.\nMurder happens. And unseen evildoers are responsible for it all. But the\n\u201cwho\u201d is never as interesting as the \u201cwhy .\u201d Unlike the Golden Fleece, a\ngood Whydunit isn\u2019t about the hero changing, it\u2019s about the audience\ndiscovering something about human nature they did not think was possible\nbefore the \u201ccrime\u201d was committ ed and the \u201ccase\u201d began. Like Citizen Kane ,\na classic Whydunit, the story is about seeking the innermost chamber of the\nhuman heart and discovering something unexpected, something dark and\noften unattractive, and the answer to the question: Why?\nChinatown  is perhaps the best Whydunit ever made, and a textbook\nexample of great screenwriting.  It\u2019s one of those movies that you can see a\nthousand times and drive deeper into smaller and smaller rooms of the\nNautilus shell with each viewin g. What makes it a great Whydunit is what\nmakes all classic Whydunits work. From China Syndr ome to All the\nPresident\u2019 s Men to JFK to Mystic River , every detectiv e story or social\ndrama, these stories walk on the dark side. They take us to the shadowy part\nof the street. And the rules are simple. We in the audience are the\ndetectives, ultimately . While we have a surrogate or surrogates onscreen\ndoing the work for us, it\u2019s we who must ultimately sift through the\ninformation, and we who must be shocked by what we find.\nIf your movie is about this type of discovery , take a look at the great\nWhydunits. Note how a surrogate onscreen represents us. And see why the\ninvestigation into the dark side of humanity is often an investigation into\nourselves in an M.C. Escher -kaleidoscopic-reptile-eating-its-own-tail kinda\nway. That\u2019 s what a good Whydu nit does \u2014 it turns the x-ray machine back\non ourselves and asks: \u201cAre we this evil?\u201d\nTHE FOOL TRIUMPHANT\nThe \u201cFool\u201d is an important character in myth and legend and has been\nforever . On the outside, he\u2019s just the Village Idiot, but further examination\nreveals him to be the wisest among us. Being such an underdog gives the\nFool the advantage of anonymity , and also makes everyone underestimate\nhis ability , allowing him or her the chance to ultimately shine.\nThe Fool in the movies goes back to Chaplin, Keaton, and Lloyd.\nLittle men, silly men, overlooked men, who triumph by luck and pluck and\nthe specialness that comes from not giving up despite the odds. In modern\nmovies, Dave , Being There, Amadeus , Forrest Gump , and many of the\nmovies of Steve Martin, Bill Murray , and Ben Stiller come to mind as\nexamples of how this tradition has evolved and why it will always have a\nplace.\nThe operating principal of \u201cThe Fool Triumphant\u201d is to set the\nunderdog Fool against a bigger , more powerful, and often \u201cestablishment\u201d\nbad guy. Watching a so-called \u201cidiot\u201d get the goat of those society deems to\nbe the winners in life gives us all hope, and pokes fun at the structures we\ntake so seriously in our day-to -day lives. Thus, no establishment is too\nsacred to be skewered, from the White House (Dave ) to success in the\nbusiness world (The Jerk ) to the overblown reverence for the importance of\nour culture ( Forrest Gump ).\nThe working parts of a Fool Triumphant movie are simple: an\nunderdog \u2014 who is seemingly  so inept and so unequipped for life that\neveryone around  him discounts his odds for success (and does so repeatedly\nin the set-up) \u2014 and an institu tion for that underdog to attack. Often, the\nFool has an accomplice, an \u201cinsi der\u201d who is in on the joke and can\u2019t believe\nthe Fool is getting away with his \u201cruse\u201d: Salieri in Amadeus , the Doctor in\nBeing There, Lieutenant Dan in Forrest Gump . These characters often get\nthe brunt of the slapstick, the guy at the end of the Rube Goldb erg chain of\nevents the Fool sets into motion, who ultimately gets the pie in the face, like\nHerbert Lom in The Pink Panther . Their crime is being close to the idiot,\nseeing him for what he really is, and being stupid enough to try to interfere.\nSpecial Fools, whether they\u2019re in comedies or dramas like Charly  and\nAwakenings , offer us a glimpse of the life of the outsider . We all feel like\nthat at times, and tales of the Fool Triumphant give us the vicari ous thrill of\nvictory .\nINSTITUTIONALIZED\nWhere would we be without each other? And when we band together\nas a group with a common cause, we reveal the ups and downs of\nsacrificing the goals of the few for those of the many . Thus, the genre I call\n\u201cInstitutionalized\u201d tells stories about groups, institutions, and \u201cfamilies.\u201d\nThese stories are special because they both honor the institution  and expose\nthe problems of losing one\u2019 s identity to it.\nOne Flew Over the Cuckoo\u2019 s Nest is about a group of mental patients.\nAmerican Beauty  is about a group of modern suburbanites. M*A*S*H  is\nabout the American military . The Godfather  is abou t a Mafia family . Each\nhas a breakout character whose role is to expose the group goal as a fraud.\nJack Nicholson, Kevin Spacey , Donald Sutherland, and Al Pacino,\nrespectively , carry this role in these films.\nThe reason I\u2019ve dubbed these stories Institutionalized is that the group\ndynamic these tales tell is often crazy and even self-destructive. \u201cSuicide Is\nPainless,\u201d the theme song of M*A*S*H , isn\u2019t so much about the insanity of\nwar as the insanity of the herd mentality . When we put on a uniform, be it\nthe uniform of the Army or a comfortable cotton shirt with a little polo\nplayer over the pocket, we give up who we are to a certain extent. And\nthese movies are all about the pros and cons of putting the group ahead of\nourselves. Again, this is a very \u201ccaveman\u201d kind of story . Loyalty to the\ngroup sometimes flies in the face of common sense, even survival, but we\ndo it. And we have done it forever . To watch others fight that battle, just\nlike we do every day , is why this genre is so popular\u2026 and so primal .\nOften movies of the Institutionalized category will be told from the\npoint of view of a newcomer . He is us \u2014 a virgin who is new to this group\nand who is being brought into it by someone who is more experienced. Jane\nFonda in 9 to 5 and Tom Hulce in Animal House  are examples. For any\nworld in which the technology , lingo, or rules are not familiar to the average\nviewer , these characters can be invaluable relayers of exposition. They can\nliterally ask \u201cHow does that work?\u201d and allow you to explain the\nimportance to everybody . It\u2019s a way to show what is often a \u201ccrazy\u201d world\nto us civilians.\nUltimately , all the stories in this category come down to a question:\nWho\u2019 s crazier , me or them? All one need do to understand how sacrificing\noneself for the group can be an insane proposition is to check out Al\nPacino\u2019 s face at the end of Godfather 2. Here is a guy who has commi tted\nsuicide for the good of the family and \u201ctradition.\u201d And look where it got\nhim. It is just as shocking as Kevin Spacey\u2019 s last-minute discovery in\nAmerican Beauty  and mirrors, almost exactly , Jack Nicholson\u2019 s blank post-\noperative expression in Cuckoo\u2019 s Nest. Why? Because it\u2019s the same movie,\nwith the same message, told in extremely dif ferent and moving ways.\nBut they all work for a reason.\nBecause each movie followed the rules.\nAnd they gave us the same thing\u2026 only dif ferent.\nSUPERHERO\nThe \u201cSuperhero \u201d genre is the exact opposite of Dude with a Problem\nand can best be defined by its opposite definition: An extraordi nary person\nfinds himself in an ordinary world. Like Gulliver tied to the beach by the\nLilliputians, a Superhero tale asks us to lend human qualiti es, and our\nsympathy , to a super being, and identify with what it must be like to have to\ndeal with the likes of us little people. No wonder so many brain y geeks and\nteens read comic books! They don\u2019t have far to go to get in sync and\nidentify with what it\u2019 s like to be so misunderstood.\nThis genre goes beyond stories about guys in capes and tights,\nhowever . It is more than the Marvel universe or the DC Comics  characters.\nGladiator  and A Beautiful Mind  (both Russell Crowe vehicles \u2014 another\nhmmm, interesting ) are good examples of human superheroes that are\nchallenged by the mediocre world around them. In both those films, it is the\ntiny minds that surround the hero that are the real problem. Don\u2019 t they get\nit? Well, no they don\u2019t. That\u2019 s why being \u201cspecial\u201d is so difficult.\nFrankenstein , Dracula , and X-Men  are the same in this regard. Ultimately ,\nall superhero tales are about being \u201cdif ferent,\u201d a feeling with which even we\nLilliputians can identify . Born into a world he did not create, the Superhero\nmust deal with those who are jealous of his unique point of view and\nsuperior mind. And from time to time we all feel this way. Anybody who\u2019 s\never been shot down at the PTA or sneered at for bold thinking in a meeting\nat work can identify with Frankenstein\u2019 s monster being chased by an angry\nmob of mouth-breathers with pitchforks and torches.\nThe problem of how to have sympathy for the likes of millionaire\nBruce Wayne or genius Russell Crowe, is solved by stressing the pain that\ngoes hand-in-hand with having these advantages. It\u2019s not easy being Bruce\nWayne. The poor guy is tortured! And while it might be cheaper to get\ntherapy (if he can afford a Bat-utility belt, he can certainly pay 150 bucks\nan hour for a shrink), Bruce Wayne is admirable because he eschews his\npersonal comfor t in the effort to give back to the community . This is so\noften why the first movie in a Superhero series succeeds and ones that\nfollow don\u2019t (such as Robocop 2). The creation myth that begins each\nSuperhero franchise stresses sympathy for the Superhero\u2019 s plight. Once\nestablished, filmmakers forget to re-create that sympathy and draw us into\nthe human side of the Superher o again. (Spider -Man 2 avoids this mistake\nand, not surprisingly , was a smash hit.)\nIn truth, we will never truly understand the Superhero. Indeed our\nidentification with him must come from sympathy for the plight of being\nmisunderstood. If you are writing a Superhero movie, a wide range of tales\nare available for dissection. It\u2019s a long-standing story type for a reason: It\ngives flight to our greatest fantasies about our potential, while tempering\nthose fantasies with a dose of reality .\nHOLL YWOOD\u2019S DIR TY LITTLE SECRET\nI\u2019m sure having reviewed this list of genres you\u2019re not only seeing\nwhy so many movies are structurally identical to others, but have had many\n\u201cEureka!\u201d moments when you\u2019re convinced that outright \u201cstealing\u201d has\nbeen perpetrated.\nAnd guess what? Y ou\u2019re not so wrong to think that.\nLook at Point Break starring Patrick Swayze, then look at Fast and\nFurious . Yes, it\u2019s the same movie almost beat for beat. But one is about\nsurfing, the other is about hot cars. Is that stealing? Is that cheating? Now\nlook at The Matrix  and compare and contrast it with the Disney/Pixar hit\nMonsters, Inc. Yup. Same movie. And there\u2019 s a million more examples:\nWho Saved Roger Rabbit?  is Chinatown . Blank Check  is very similar to\nHome Alone . In some instances, the stealing  is conscious. In others, it\u2019s just\ncoincidence. But very often the reason it happens is that story templates\nwork and they work for a reason that must  be repeated. Each of these\nmovies is an example of successful storytelling. Several are huge hits. Do\nyou think anyon e is complaining that Fast and Furious  ripped off the story\nbeats of Point Br eak? Did anyone notice but you and me? Doubtful.\nThe point I\u2019m trying to get across here is \u2014 it works. And it works for\na reason . Because the laws of physics that govern storytelling work every\ntime, in every situation. Your job is to learn why it work s and how these\nstory cogs fit together . When it seems like you\u2019re stealing \u2014 don\u2019t. When it\nfeels like a clich\u00e9 \u2014 give it a twist. When you think it\u2019s familiar \u2014 it\nprobably is, so you\u2019ve got to find a new way. But at least understand why\nyou\u2019re tempted to use the clich\u00e9 and the familiar story . The rules are there\nfor a reason. Once you get over feeling confined by these rules, you\u2019ll be\namazed at how freeing they are. True originality can\u2019t begin until you know\nwhat you\u2019re breaking away from.\nSUMMAR Y\nThe topic of genre dictates the categorizing of movies. But instead of\ntypical categories such as Romantic Comedy or Heist Movie, we\u2019ve created\n10 new ones that define story types. These categories are all you need for\nnow to help you identify the story mechanics of the movie idea you\u2019re\nworking on. Y ou will not need to find exclusions to them.\nOr have I written those wor ds pr ematur ely?\nYou are a screenwriter . And as I said in Chapter One, all good\nscreenwriters are bullheads. So I know what your response to the hard work\nand years of experience that went into what I\u2019ve just related to you is: What\nabout the exceptions?  What about Breakfast Club ? Huh? Is that Rites of\nPassage or Institutionalized? (Answer: Institutionalized). Oh, yeah, well\nwhat about Rain Man? Is that a Gold en Fleece or a Buddy Love movie?\n(Answer: Buddy Love). Okay smart guy, what about Ben Stiller \u2019s\nZoolander ???? (Answer: It\u2019s just a bad movie!! Actually , it\u2019s one of my\nfavorite bad movies. But it\u2019s also a great example of\u2026 the Superhero\ngenre.)\nIf you\u2019re looking for the exceptions to the rules, you\u2019re missing the\npoint of this chapter, which is to use categorizing as a storytelling tool. You\nmust  know movies. But you can\u2019t know them all. So this is a way to start.\nTake the script you\u2019re working on and try to find what catego ry it\u2019s most\nlike. Maybe you have moments in your script that borrow from all the\ncategories? Maybe you start off your screenplay telling one type of story\nand end up tellin g another . That\u2019 s fine, too. (I mean, at the end of the day,\nI doubt you\u2019ll sell that script, but we all have to learn the hard way. We\u2019re\nscreenwriters! Pain is the game!)\nThe point is to be well-versed in the language, rhythm, and goals of the\ngenre you\u2019re trying to move forward. If you know what genre you\u2019re in,\nlearn its rules and find what\u2019 s essential; you\u2019ll write a better and more\nsatisfying movie.\nAnd have a better chance to sell it.\nWhat\u2019 s so great about these genres is how inspiring they are \u2014 at least\nto me. Seeing these genres laid out, and seeing their heritage \u2014 often going\nback to very ancient and familiar tales \u2014 tells me that the job of \u201cGive me\nthe same thing\u2026 only different\u201d is not new. Jaws  is just a retellin g of the\nancient Greek myth of the Minatour or even the dragon-slayer  tales of the\nMiddle Ages. Superman  is just a mode rn Hercules . Road Trip is just an\nupdate of Chaucer \u2019s Canterbury Tales \u2014 isn\u2019t it? To not know the roots of\nthe story you\u2019re trying to creat e, either from the last 100 years of movie\nstorytelling or the last thousand, is to not honor the traditions and\nfundamental goals of your job.\n\u201cGive me the same thing\u2026 only different\u201d then is what story telling\nhas always  been about. But it\u2019s the way we put new twists on old tales,\nbring them up to date, and give them a spin that\u2019s meaningful for our\ncontemporaries. It\u2019s a skill we must master and apply to all aspects of the\ncraft. And in the next chapter , we\u2019ll discuss how to take all this wonderful\nbackground and draw out the most important part: the hero.\nEXERCISES\n \n1. Pick up the movie section of your newspaper . Review each of the\nmovies available and decide what genre they fall into. If you go see\nthat movie, compare and contrast it with the other movies in that\ngenre. W ere you drawn to it because of the type of movie it is?\n2. Grab your hand y TV Guide  and go to the movie loglines. Going\ndown the list to check films you\u2019ve seen, write what genre each falls\ninto. (Using the categories above, simply assign a number to each\nmovie you\u2019ve seen.) Does it work? Does every movie listed fall into a\ngenre?\n3. For the movie idea or script you\u2019re working on now, decide what\ncategory it falls into. Then make a list of other movies in that genre.\nAs homework, go to your local Blockbuster and see how many of\nthese are available. Make notes about how they compare and contrast\nto each other . Can you better explain what type of movie your idea or\nfinished script is part of?\n4. Finally , for those of you who love to find exceptions to the rules,\nmake up your own genre and give it a name. Find three other movies\nin that genre. Can you find five? Maybe you\u2019ve discovered a new\ngenre!\nIf you come up with a brand new genre category , use my e-mail\naddress found in the exercise section of Chapter One and send it to me. If\nit\u2019s really a good one, I may even include it in subsequent editions of this\nbook.\nThe next step in figuring out what your movie is about is to figure out\nwhom  it\u2019s about.\nAs my wise old father used to say, \u201cTell me a story about a guy\nwho\u2026\u201d\nAnd after the concept, whenever  I hear a screenwriter wind up to pitch\nhis movie idea, somewhere in there I better hear some version of: \u201cIt\u2019s\nabout a guy who\u2026 \u201d\nWhy is this?\nWell, it\u2019s like anything connected with trying to communicate an idea.\nThe \u201cwho\u201d is our way in. We, the audience, zero in on and project onto the\n\u201cwho\u201d whether it\u2019s an epic motion picture or a commercial for Tide\ndeter gent. The \u201cwho\u201d gives us someone to identify with \u2014 and that\nsomeone doesn \u2019t even have to be human. Why do mascots and\nspokespeople like the Jack character in all those Jack-in-the-Box\ncommercials \u2014 or any talking corporate icon for that matter \u2014 draw us\ninto the \u201cstory\u201d of the product being sold? It\u2019s because it\u2019s easier to\ncommunicate an idea when someone is standing there experiencing it for\nus. And whether we\u2019re watching Lawr ence of Arabia  as Lawrence tries to\nfigure out how to attack Acaba \u201c\u2026from the land! \u201d or a Tylenol commercial\nin which a busy Soccer Mom wonders when her headache will go away , the\nprinciple of involving us in the story is the same.\nAs screenwriters with a great idea for a movie, the job of creating\nheroes that will lure an audience  into our world is unique. We have to create\naudience stand-i ns that resonate for our target market AND serve the needs\nand goals of our story . And it starts from the very beginning with that great\nlogline that hooks us with some one to identify with as much as something .\nThis is why in any logline, any good logline, there will always be a couple\nof adjectives involved: A risk-averse teacher who\u2026 an agoraphobic\nstenographer who\u2026 a milquetoast banker who\u2026. This also goes for the\nantagonist who now must be described as an overprotective cop, a\nmegalomaniac terrorist, or a homicidal baker . So let\u2019s add a few things to\nour list of what the \u201cperfect\u201d logline must include to be truly compelling:\n \n> An adjective to describe the hero\n> An adjective to describe the bad guy , and\u2026\n> A compelling goal we identify with as human beings\nBy giving us even these thumbnail sketches of whom we are going to\nbe following \u2014 as well as the bad guy who is trying to block our hero from\nachieving his goal \u2014 we get a better snapshot of what is involved so we can\nlatch onto, get interested in, and follow the story . But how are we going to\ndo all that? How  are we going  to satisfy our great story AND create the\n\u201cright\u201d characters to sell it?\nWHO IS THIS ABOUT?\nEvery movie, even ensemble pieces like Pulp Fiction  \u201cstarring\u201d John\nTravolta or Crimes and Misdemeanors  \u201cstarring\u201d Woody Allen, has to have\na lead character . It has to be about  someone. It has to have one or two main\npeople we can focus our attentio n on, identify with, and want to root for \u2014\nand someone who can carry the movie\u2019 s theme.\nAs impo rtant as creating this type of hero is, and singling him out even\nif we\u2019re writing an ensemble piece, the hero isn\u2019t always the first thing we\nthink of, or the way we come at creating a \u201ccan\u2019 t lose\u201d movie idea. I hate to\nadmit it, but I rarely begin writing any movie with the \u201cwho\u201d in mind. More\noften it\u2019s the idea first. And if the hero is a part of the idea \u2014 well, that\u2019s\njust gravy. Many  will tell you differently , and this is only my approach, but\nI think the \u201cwho\u201d has to serve the \u201cwhat is it?\u201d \u2014 not the other way around.\nAnd once you have that golden idea, that winning pitch, that perfect hook,\nand don\u2019t quite yet have the \u201cwho,\u201d it\u2019s time to go to work to enhance the\nidea with the right characters, especially the hero of the story .\nIt\u2019s all about making the \u201cWhat is it?\u201d work better .\nIn many cases, the key to figur ing out whom this story is about and\nwhat type of person is leading the action is right there in your logline. In the\nscripts I\u2019ve sold, many times the initial concept gave me the roadmap and\nall I had to do was clarify . In Poker Night , a comedy Colby Carr and I sold\nto Disney , the pitch is the characters: \u201cA henpecked husband finally gets the\nhouse to himself one weekend and loses it in a poker game to an\nunscrupulous gambler .\u201d It\u2019s \u201cRisky Business  with a Dad.\u201d Need I say more?\nTo service that concept all we had to do was play with the balance of the\nhero and the villain \u2014 and make it about Dad\u2019 s journey from henpecked to\nempowered.\nAnother comedy  we came up with and sold to Universal, called Third\nGrade , has an equally  simple premise. This is a story about an adult man\nwho has to go back to third grade. After being caught in a speed trap in\nfront of his old school, the hero is ordered by the judge to be sent back to\nthird grade to learn some manners. Easy concept, right? But who is the best\nperson to put in this situation? What person would offer the most comic\nconflict given that punishment? What hero would offer \u201cthe longest\njourney\u201d and need to learn the biggest lesson? Any takers?  Well, in the\ndevelopment process it became clear . The guy who needs that lesson most\nis someone who has yet to grow up. On the outside he is a successful\nbusinessman, a guy up for a promotion at his work \u2014 designing violent\nvideo games for kids (ironic, no?) \u2014 but who has yet to learn the basics of\nHuman Being School.\nThis is a guy who needs  to go back to third grade, but doesn\u2019 t know it\nyet. And only this adventure will give him the comic lessons he so richly\ndeserves. It\u2019s a sweet little movie idea, the poster is inherent in the premise;\nit\u2019s a guy in an Armani suit and a cell phone squeezed into a tiny desk\nsurrounded by out-of-control eight-year olds and maybe a \u201cKic k Me\u201d sign\ntaped to his back. Get it? Well, of course you do. But the gimmick of\nsending someone back to third grade wouldn\u2019 t mean anything unless we\nfigured out the perfect hero to take that journey .\nAMPING UP THE LOGLINE\nMany times, your great initial idea will only give you a hint of what\nhas to be done to create the hero that sells your idea best. To make the idea\nwork, very often you have to play with the characters in order to give your\nhero the most conflict, the longest journey , and the most primal goal to\n\u201camp up\u201d the idea for maximum impact. T o make this clear , let\u2019s look at our\nloglines cited in Chapter One and tinker around with other possible \u201cwhos\u201d\nfor these ideas.\nIn 4 Christmases , all I know is that the two leads are a young couple.\nThey both come from families of divorce and re-marriage \u2014 thus the\nproblem of having to see all four of their families on Christmas Day. My\nguess is that this is a couple that wants to be together forever , but is having\nproblems at the get-go. They eschew their families and the problems they\ngrew up with; they don\u2019t want to get divorced. But maybe it\u2019s not all\npeaches and cream: They\u2019re newlyweds! So this day will be a test for them.\nDo they want to go the way of their parents? Or do they want to go their\nown way, form a permanent bond, and never get divorced? Granted, I have\nnot read the script. I have no idea what the writers chose to do, but that\u2019 s the\nway I\u2019d go.\nAnd suddenly , given this very deep and primal urge, the urge to stay\ncommitted and be in love forever despite their families, this couple is worth\nrooting for. That\u2019 s a movie I\u2019d like to see because those are characters I\nwant to see win. So swiftly , this \u201ceasy\u201d premise has real meaning. We have\nnot only identif ied the \u201cright\u201d characters for this story , but given them a\nbuilt-in, Alpha-O mega journey to take in the course of this movie. Now the\nstory IS the characters. And you thought it was just a funny poster!\nIn Ride Along , part of the pitch, part of the mental picture that makes\nthe idea crackle for me, is the adjectives. A \u201crisk-averse\u201d teache r goes on a\nride along with his brother -in-la w, an \u201cover -protective\u201d cop, and the goal is\nprimal: the love of the woman they both care about. Those adjectives tell\nme exactly where this story is going. It\u2019s a trial by fire for the teacher: Is he\nbrave enough to overcome his fear and win the hand of his fianc\u00e9e in the\n\u201creal\u201d world of manly cops? If he loves her , he will.\nBut now let\u2019s take that same ride-along idea and try some different\ncharacters in their places. Wha t if we could do anything with this basic\npremise? What if the young man who is wooing the sister is not a teacher\nbut an ex-Green Beret? Well, now it\u2019s a different movie. It warps the way it\nplays out in my mind. Now to make the comic conflict come to life, you\nmake the cop the scaredy-cat. He\u2019s Barney Fife and his future brother -in-\nlaw will be teaching him a thing or two between reminiscences of the Gulf\nWar and a few demonstrations of his \u201cthousand-yard stare.\u201d And odds are\nthe ride along would be the ex-Green Beret\u2019 s idea. Suddenly  it\u2019s a very\ndifferent movie,  isn\u2019t it? But it\u2019s another way to go. It just shows how you\ncan have a good idea \u2014 and absolutely wreck it with the wrong characters.\nTo me, the original idea works best.\nIn the example of The Retreat, again the adjec tives come into play to\ntell us the writers most likely did it right. The way they have it \u201ccast\u201d now,\nit\u2019s about a wet-behind-the-ears (read: young) company employee\u2019 s first\ntaste of corporat e life at a weekend retreat \u2014 and someone\u2019 s trying to kill\nhim. Funny! But let\u2019s play around with the character to see other ways they\ncould have gone with this same  premise. What if the person going on the\nretreat is 65, has been at the company for 20 years, and is about to retire?\nOkay . So now it\u2019s about a company \u201cdownsizing\u201d its employ ees for real\nbefore they can collect their retirement benefits. Same idea basically: a\ncorporate retreat; a series of murder attempts; a paranoid who doesn\u2019 t know\nwhy he\u2019s being targeted. But the journey\u2019 s a lot different\u2026 and so is the\nmoral. And so is the audience: no one will show up for that movie. At best\nit\u2019s an Indie starring Jack Lemmon, and Jack is, well, dead.\nThe point is that amping up a great logline with the hero who makes\nthe idea work best is how the idea comes to life. And let\u2019s be clear , the trick\nis to create heroes who:\n \n> Offer the most conflict  in that situation\n> Have the longest way to go  emotionally and\u2026\n> Are the most demographically pleasing !\nOn this last point, I have particu lar experience now that I am over 40.\nNowadays, I must always catch myself when thinking of my movie heroes.\nIn my mind everyone  is 40. And the heroes (in my mind), the ones that I am\npersonally drawn to anyway , are now all \u201cexistential heroes\u201d \u2014 a little\nworld-weary and yet bravely wise. Yeah! Right!  And the audience that\u2019s\ngoing to show up for that movie is\u2026 well, A.W.O.L. to be honest. (But, if it\ngets made, the French will hail me as a genius.)\nWhenever I find myself driftin g into thinking about writing starring\nroles for Tim Allen, Steve Martin, or Chevy Chase, I catch myself and\nrealize where I am: youth-obsessed Hollywood. Those guys are fine in\nensemble, as part of a four-quadrant family pic, great, but as the lead?\nNever . Okay, rarely . My solution, once I do catch myself and give up on\ntrying to change  things, is to make that great character with the existential\ndilemma a teenager , and make that married couple who\u2019 s havin g a crisis a\ntwenty-something  married  couple. This is the crowd that shows up for\nmovies. These are the heroes the audience likes to see onscreen at their\nlocal Cineplex.\nWhy fight City Hall?\nThe age of characters I think up is my particular blind spot; you have\nyours. But keep in mind what our job is here: mass market, high concept\nposter movies for everybody , all over the world. Do not think that just\nbecause you and all your friend s prefer something, or are in on a certain\ntrend or fad, or like a type of person, that everyone else will, too. I have\nactually been pitched a movie that the writer said was a great \u201cJulio Iglesias\nvehicle\u201d \u2014 I swear! \u2014 won\u2019 t everybody  show up for that premiere?\n(Mucho doubto. ) This is why I stress getting out and pitching your movie\nideas to real people in the real world to get their reaction.\nThis discussion of blind spots reminds me of a favorite story my father\nused to tell. He worked in Adve rtising early on and one time was trying to\nsell a client on buying TV time on Sundays. The client, a wealthy man,\nbalked at this idea and had a very studied reason: \u201cNo one stays home and\nwatches TV on Sunday ,\u201d he explained. \u201cEveryone\u2019 s out playing polo!\u201d\nA lesson in perspective for us all.\nTHE PRIMAL URGE\nAs stressed throughout this book, let me just say again:\nPrimal, primal, primal!\nOnce you\u2019ve got the hero, the motivation for the hero to succeed must\nbe a basic one. What does X want? Well, if it\u2019s a promotion  at work, it\nbetter damn well be related to winning the hand of X\u2019s beloved or saving up\nenough money to get X\u2019s daugh ter an operation. And if it\u2019s a match-up with\nan enem y, it better well lead to a life-or -death showdown, not just a friendly\nspitball fight.\nWhy?\nIt\u2019s because primal urges get our attention. Survival, hunger , sex,\nprotection of loved ones, fear of death grab us.\nThe best ideas and the best characters in the lead roles must have basic\nneeds, wants, and desires. Basic, basic!\nDon\u2019 t believe me?\nThen let\u2019s look at our three loglines and take out the primal- ness in\neach to see how our desire to see each wanes:\nWhat if in 4 Christmases , the lead coup le isn\u2019t married? What if\nthey\u2019re just friends who grew up together and share Christma s with each\nother \u2019s family every year? Same premise. But take out the sex and what\nhave you got? No stakes. Nothing is on the line. It\u2019s still funny . It\u2019s still the\nsame idea. But I have no primal rooting interest. Pass!\nIn Ride Along , try taking out the sister/fianc\u00e9e. What if the doofus\nteacher just signs up for a ride along with a cop \u2014 any cop. Well, in this\ngin-rummy hand  of primal-ness I\u2019ve still got: survival. This teacher still has\nto make it throu gh the night and there will still be risks to his life. But\nhaving the cop\u2019s sister/teacher \u2019s fianc\u00e9e as the goal makes the stakes\nresonate with primal-ness. Again, as in the examples in Chapter Two, it\u2019s\nalmost a knight -errant tale, isn\u2019t it? But having the princess as the prize\nmakes it work whether it\u2019 s set in the modern day \u2018hood or the Middle Ages.\nOne more. Just to grind it in.\nThe Retreat. Let\u2019s take out the danger . What if there aren\u2019 t any\nmurders? What if it\u2019s all pranks played on the newbie executive. Well,\nwhere are the stakes? To make this idea work you must have the threat of\ndeath; otherwis e it\u2019s a corporate training film, or worse, an existential\nmetaphor .\nAnd yes, this is all about your hero. Give him stakes. Real stakes.\nPrimal  stakes. Stakes that are basic, that we understand. Make the hero\nwant something real and simple: survival, hunger , sex, protection of loved\nones, fear of death.\nAnd when it comes to who to cast in your screenplay , we respond best\nto stories of husbands and wive s, fathers and daughters, mothers and sons,\nex-boyfriends and girlfriends. Why? Because we all have these people in\nour lives! You say \u201cfather\u201d and I see my father. You say \u201cgirlfriend\u201d and I\nsee my girlfriend. We all have \u2019em \u2014 and it gets our attention because of\nthat. It\u2019s an immediate attention- getter because we have a primal reaction to\nthose people, to those words even! So when in doubt, ground your\ncharacters in the most deep-seat ed imagery you can. Make it relevant to us.\nMake it something that every caveman (and his brother) will get.\nMake it, say it with me now\u2026 primal!\nCASTING FOR THE ROLE OF YOUR HERO\nOne of the pitfalls of being a savvy movie writer is knowing who\namong the acting set is looking to do what part next. Adam wants to do a\ndrama next \u2014 to get his Oscar nod. Ditto Jim. Ditto Steve. (After Lost in\nTranslation , ditto everybod y!) We have also seen everyone\u2019 s most recen t\nmovie, may or may not know what\u2019s in production next, and think  we know\nwho\u2019d be perfect for the movie we are writing.\nLet me state here and now: W e do not know!\nThis is all a long way of saying:\n \n> Don\u2019 t cast the movie before you\u2019ve sold the script!\n> Don\u2019 t write parts for certain actors!\n> Don\u2019 t get married to the idea of one particular actor doing the\npart \u2014 you\u2019ll always  be disappointed.\nRare is the occasion when dream script meets dream cast. And let me\ngive you an example of learning the hard way:\nThe amazing Sheldon Bull and I wrote a hilarious comedy in 2004.\nWhat if the President\u2019 s helicopter goes down behind enemy lines? And\nwhat if he is forced to capture Osama bin Laden \u2014 all by himself? That\nwas our premise. It\u2019s about a President who finds his \u201cinner leader .\u201d It\u2019s\n\u201cGalaxy Quest  with Geor ge W. Bush.\u201d Great, huh? We even had a great\ntitle: Chickenhawk Down . And here\u2019 s why we did not sell that script:\nBecause there are about two people who can play the part of the President.\nIt\u2019s the lead. And there really isn\u2019t anyone out there who can \u201copen\u201d that\nmovie. Tim Allen was our first choice. And\u2026 who else?  What we had done\nwas paint oursel ves into a corner on casting. Yes, it\u2019s funny . Yes, it\u2019s a great\nstory . Yes, someday it will get made (by God!) but right now it just sits\nthere. Hear the crickets?\nWe are professional screenwrite rs and we should have known better .\nBut we got so caught up in our idea (see!? ) that we didn\u2019 t think it all the\nway through. The point is to leave yourself plenty of room for casting. Your\nleads should be able to be played by many actors and actresses. And they\nshould all be able to \u201copen\u201d the movie. This is yet another reason why\nyoung actors are in such deman d: They\u2019re so damn many of them! And no,\nyou do not know  what parts actors are looking for. Even if you hear it from\ntheir manager . Even if the actor looks you in the eye and tells you that their\nnext movie, the role he really  wants, is a comedy where he plays a teacher .\nHe is lying. He is an actor . Love ly, charming people to be sure,  but skittish\nas thoroughbreds.\nThey do not know what they want to do next.\nAnd neither do you.\nACT OR ARCHETYPES\nThat said, why is it that certain actors always play certain parts over\nand over again?  As hinted at in Chapter Two, you find throughout cinema\nhistory that many of the big stars play one part really well. Think about\nMarilyn Monroe , Clark Gable, Cary Grant. Now think about Jim Carrey ,\nRussell Crowe, Julia Roberts, and Sandra Bullock. It\u2019 s not because these are\nnot good  actors  who can\u2019t do more than one type of role, only that what\nmakes movies work to a large degree is our need to be shown certain\narchetypes onscr een. And the actors who play these archetypes now are just\ntaking the place of the actors who played the same archetypes years ago.\nIsn\u2019t Russell Crowe Errol Flynn? (Even geographically?)\nIsn\u2019t Jim Carrey Jerry Lewis?\nIsn\u2019t Tom Hanks Jimmy Stewart?\nIsn\u2019t Sandra Bullock Rosalind Russell?\nThe reason is that these archetypes exist to satisfy our inner need to see\nthese shadow creations in our brains played out onscreen. It\u2019s the Jungian\narchetypes these actors represen t that we\u2019re interested in seeing.  And if you\nalways remember to write for the archetype, and not the star, the casting\nwill take care of itself. So while this may not be strictly Jungian (even\nthough I got an \u201cA\u201d in Jung) let me instead give you some  Snyderian\narchetypes for your perusal:\n \n> There \u2019s the \u201cyoung man on the rise\u201d archetype \u2014 a very\nAmerican chara cter that includes Harold Lloyd, Steve Martin (in his\nday), Adam Sandler , and the omni-versal Ashton Kutcher . Horatio\nAlger -esque, a little dumb, but plucky , this is the type we all want to\nsee win.\n> There\u2019 s the \u201cgood girl tempted\u201d archetype \u2013 pure of heart, cute\nas a bug: Betty Grable, Doris Day, Meg Ryan (in her day), Reese\nWitherspoon. This is the female  counterpart of the young man on the\nrise.\n> There\u2019s the \u201cimp,\u201d the \u201cclever and resourceful child\u201d \u2014 Jackie\nCoogan, MacCauly Culkin, and even their evil opposite, the \u201cBad\nSeed,\u201d i.e., Patty McCormick.\n> There \u2019s the \u201csex goddess\u201d archetype \u2014 Mae West to Marilyn\nMonroe to Bridget Bardot to Halle Berry .\n> And the male  version, \u201cthe hunk\u201d \u2014 From Rudolph Valentin o\nto Clark Gable, from Robert Redford to Tom Cruise to Viggo\nMortenson to Mr . and Mrs. Diesel\u2019 s pride and joy , Vin.\nAnd the list goes on. There\u2019 s the \u201cwounded soldier going back for a\nlast redemptive mission\u201d archetype: Paul Newman, and now Clint\nEastwood. There\u2019s the \u201ctroubled sexpot\u201d archetype: Veronica Lake,\nAngelina Jolie. And the lovable  fop: Cary Grant, Hugh Grant. There\u2019 s the\ncourt jester: Danny Kaye, Woody Allen, Rob Schneider . There\u2019 s the wise\ngrandfather: Alec Guinness and now \u2014 same beard, same robe \u2014 Ian\nMcKellen.\nThere are magic dwarves and tricksters, sidekicks and talking animals,\nspinsters and wizards, Falstaf fs and misers \u2014 and they keep on popping up.\nOver and over again. Same characters, same function for being in the story .\nLike knowing the history of certain story types, knowing the long line of\nancestors your characters descend from is a must.\nYou don\u2019t have to be Joseph Campbell to see that no matter who\u2019 s hot\nin Casting Call, the archetypes never change. Each one of these archetypes\nhas a story arc we want to see played out again and again. And it\u2019s all about\nmatching what we carry in the back of our minds to what we see onscreen.\nWho deserves to win and why? Who deserves comeuppance and why? And\ndespite the dicta tes of political correctness, fashion and fad, we still want to\nsee justice meted out for characters we hate and victory granted to those we\nadmire. The stories of these heroes and the mathematical equations that\nmakes their stories work is already sewn into our DNA. Your job, your\nsimple task, is to forget the stars, concentrate on the archetypes, and strive\nto make them new .\nSPECIAL CIRCUMST ANCES\nAnd now, for my bullheads in the audience, let\u2019s get to the exceptions.\nWhen it comes to creating the linear, straightforward movie hero, we pretty\nmuch understand. But what about the special circumstances? What about\nensemble? What about biographical movies? What about animated movies\nwhere the characters come from non-relevant fairy tales??\nOkay .\nYes, there are always special circumstances. But finding the hero in all\nof these examples is the same method used to find them in any original one-\nline or spec.\nTake biography . You\u2019ve been handed someone\u2019 s life story and now\nhave to make a movie out of it. So what if the hero isn\u2019t necessarily very\nlikeable? Or what if he or she did things that weren\u2019 t all that admirable,\nwhat then? Let\u2019s take a look at Kinsey . Those of you who know the story\nabout the famous sex study pioneer , Alfred Kinsey , know that the\nscreenwriter (also the director , Bill Condon) faced a problem. Kinsey was\nodd. He conduc ted sex studies on friends and neighbors, spied on his wife,\nand dabbled with his subjects in ways many might think of as objectionable.\nFinding the hero in that story also means finding a \u201cbad guy,\u201d too. But if\nthey can make a movie out of the life of porn-meister Larry Flynt, the\npublisher of Hustler  Magazine, as they did in The People vs. Larry Flynt ,\nand make him out to be a hero, well, why not follow the same formula?\nAnd that\u2019 s exactly what Condon did.\nThe writers of A Beautiful Mind  faced this same problem with\nmathematician John Nash and chose to simply fudge some of the facts of\nhis life story to make him more palatable. They dropped certain un-heroic\nfacets of his love life and merged two real wives into one for the sake of\nmovie continuity . This kind of thing, with the guidance of a good errors and\nomissions attorney , is done a lot.\nI mysel f grappled with a similar dilemma when I was handed the\nbiographical challenge of John DeLorean, the famous automaker and\ncreator of the DeLorean sports car. Imagine my surprise when my research\nproved him not to be a \u201cTucker -esque\u201d maverick brought down by the Big\nThree automakers for his radical ideas but, by some accounts, a con man.\nAll well and good, but who\u2019 s the hero in that story? My solution was to\nmake the hero the author of one of the books I\u2019d read, a guy who had been\ninside the DeLorean empire from the start and grew disillusion ed by both\nthe man and his \u201cvision.\u201d By tracing the rise and fall of DeLorean from this\ninsider \u2019s point of view , and showing how he could be fooled, it gave the\naudience the \u201cway in\u201d to that story . I even gave my script the ironic title,\nDream Car. Your way in to a biography has to pay attention to the same\nrules of any story: It has to be, first and foremost, about a guy who\u2026 we\ncan root for .\nOr at least understand.\nEnsemble pieces can offer the same dilemma for the screenwriter . And\nas the examples of John Travolta in Pulp Fiction  and Woody Allen in\nCrimes and Misdemeanors  prove, the hero doesn\u2019 t always  have to be the\none with the most scenes. But ensemble does offer a unique challenge of\nfinding your way in. Who is this about, you keep asking, this piece with 12\ncharacters, all with equal screen time?\nOne of the masters of the ensemble, director Robert Altman,\nspecializes in this. Nashville , Welcome to L.A., and Shortcuts  offer\ncrisscrossing character sketches with no central lead. But Altman would\nargue differently . The city of Nashville became the \u201cstar\u201d of Nashville , and\nShortcuts  and Welcome to L.A. \u201cstars\u201d the city of Los Ange les. Granted\nthese are not classic hero\u2019 s tales, but Altman found his way in and stuck to\nit. And by creating a new kind of hero to root for, he was true to the moral\nhe wanted to tell.\nIn ensemble, like any story , the \u201chero\u201d is usually the one who carries\nthe theme of the movie. When in doubt, ask yourself who serves this\nfunction in your movie \u2014 who comes up against the others the hardest, and\nwho grows the most? And pretty soon you\u2019re asking the same questions you\nask when finding the hero of any movie you\u2019re writing: Who offers the\nmost conflict? Who comes the farthest emotionally and who is the most\nlikeable, the one we want to root for and see win? That\u2019 s the one you have\nto make it \u201cabout.\u201d\nAnimated tales based on existing material are often difficult\nchallenges, especially when translating across cultural differences and time.\nLater we will see how the hero of Disney\u2019 s Aladdin  went from being an\nunlikable street urchin in the original text (though one who was perfectly\nacceptable to the culture in which he was created) to an affable, modern\nSurfer dude. Likewise in Disney \u2019s Mulan , Pocahontas , and The Hunchback\nof Notre Dame , the writers were presented with similar challenges and met\nwith mixed results based on changes to the hero \u2014 and how his or her story\nwas told. But whether your cast of characters is a pack of prehistoric Ice\nAge-ers or a bunch of idiosyncratic insects (Antz, A Bug\u2019s Life), the process\nof giving us a winning logline, and the hero to star in it, is exactly the same.\nThe rule of thumb in all these cases is to stick to the basics no matter\nwhat. T ell me a story about a guy who\u2026\n \n> I can identify with .\n> I can learn fr om.\n> I have compelling  reason to follow .\n> I believe deserves to win  and\u2026\n> Has stakes that are primal  and ring true for me.\nFollow that simple prescription for finding the hero of your movie and\nyou can\u2019t go wrong. No matte r what assignment, material, or sweeping\ncanvas has been handed to you, you find the hero by finding the heart of the\nstory .\nSLAVE T O THE LOGLINE\nWhen you have found the perfect hero for your story and nailed  down\njust what his primal goal is, it\u2019s time to go back to your logline and add in\nwhat you\u2019ve learned to make it perfect. And if it sounds like I am insisting\nthat you become a \u201cslave to the logline\u201d \u2014 well, you\u2019re right.\nThe logline is your story\u2019 s code, its DNA, the one constant that has to\nbe true. If it\u2019s good, if it has all the earmarks of a winning idea, then it\nshould give you everything you need to guide you in writing the screenplay .\nIt is, in short, the touchstone, both for you the writer and the audience\nyou\u2019re selling your movie to. If you are true to your loglin e, you will\ndeliver the best possible story . And if you find yourself straying from it in\nthe middle of the writing process, you better have a good reason.\nAnd this is particularly true when it comes to your hero.\nThe logline tells the hero\u2019 s story: Who he is, who he\u2019s up against, and\nwhat\u2019 s at stake. The nice, neat form of a one- or two-sentenc e pitch tells\nyou everything.  Nailing it down and sticking to it is not only a good\nexercise, it will become vital to your story as you continue to \u201cbeat it out\u201d\nand even tually write it. By examining who your hero is and what his primal\ngoal is, as well as the bad guy who is trying to stop him from achieving that\ngoal, you can better identify and expand on the needs of your story . The\nlogline with the most conflict, the most sharply defined hero and bad guy,\nand the clearest , most primal goal is the winner . And once you identify\nthose characteristics and it works, stick to it. Use that logline to double-\ncheck your results as you begin to execute your screenplay . And if you find\na better way in the writing, make sure you go back and re-enun ciate it. But\nfrom beginning to end, making it \u201cabout a guy who\u2026\u201d keeps you on track.\nAnd the logline helps you continue to double-check your math from initial\nconcept to F ADE OUT .\nSUMMAR Y\nFinding the hero of your story is the second most important part of\ncoming up with a winning movie concept \u2014 winning meaning \u201cone that\nwill sell.\u201d Cast and concept is, in fact, the starting point of getting any\nmovie made. \u201cWhat\u2019 s it abou t?\u201d and \u201cWho\u2019 s in it?\u201d are the first two\nquestions any moviegoer asks, and that goes for everyone else as well, from\nagent and producer to studio executive. It\u2019s how the \u201cwho\u201d and the \u201cwhat is\nit?\u201d come togeth er in an intrigu ing combination that makes us want to see\nthis story unfold.\nThe perfect hero is the one who offers the most conflict in the\nsituation, has the longest emotional journey , and has a primal goal we can\nall root for. Survival, hunger , sex, protection of loved ones, and fear of\ndeath grab us. It is usually someone we can identify with prima lly, too, and\nthat\u2019s why mothers and daughters, fathers and sons, brothers and sisters,\nhusbands and wives make bette r characters than mere strangers facing the\nsame situations and storylines.\nWhen committin g these discoveries to your logline, you must have an\nadjective to describe the hero, an adjective to describe the bad guy, and a\ndefinite and primal goal or setting.\nEXERCISES\n \n1. Review your list of movies in the genre you are trying to execute\nand write out the logline for each. Give attention \u2014 and great\nadjectives \u2014 to the type of hero, the type of bad guy, and the hero\u2019 s\nprimal goal.\n2. What actor archetypes can you identify from the list of movies in\nyour genre? What type of character is the lead portraying and what\nactors from the past could play those parts as well as the modern-day\nstar?\n3. Name an ensemble movie and identify its hero. Does every movie\nhave to have a hero? Name other movies where the story required no\nmain hero.\n4. Finally , if you feel really daring, try writing a logline for this idea:\nA guy gets a talking car. Knowing what you know about how to amp\nup the hero, the bad guy, and the primal goal, write a logline for that\nidea. And make sure you use adjectives that grab us.\nItching to start writing your screenplay?\nOf course you are!\nWill I let you start writing your screenplay?\nKeep itching!\nBut you certainly are getting closer. And think about all that you\u2019ve\naccomplished so far. You\u2019ve polished your one-line and pitched enough\n\u201ccivilians\u201d to know you\u2019ve got a good one. You\u2019ve screen ed a dozen\nmovies that are in the category of story you\u2019re trying to tell. You\u2019ve come\nup with the perfect hero and antagonist, and amped up both the hero\u2019 s\nprimal goal and the conflict in the way of his achieving it. And now it\u2019s\ntime to take all that great info you\u2019ve gleaned about your script and figure\nout how to write the sucker .\nThere is no greater thrill when I am working on a newly born movie\nidea than the battle cry: \u201cLet\u2019 s beat it out!\u201d\nIt means it\u2019s time to put all those great scenes and ideas and characters\n\u201cup on The Board\u201d and see what goes where, which character does what,\nand whether you need every scene you\u2019ve imagined\u2026 or have to invent all\nnew ones.\nIt\u2019s time to do the measure-twice/cut-once calculation that will save\nyou time, allow you to pitch \u201cbeat for beat\u201d and build the foundation and\nironwork of your screenplay .\nIt\u2019s time to talk about structur e.\nSTRUCTURE, STRUCTURE, STRUCTURE\u2026\nAfter coming up with the idea, and identifying the \u201cwho\u201d in your\nmovie \u2014 and who it\u2019s for \u2014 the structure is the single most important\nelement in writing and selling a screenplay . Good structure is ironclad. And\nwhen you sell your script, having a well-structured screenplay will show\nthat you have really done the work in making a blueprint that is solid and\nsound. The credit jumpers  can change the order of your scenes; they can\nerase your dialo gue; they can add new characters and take others away \u2014\nand they will! \u2014 but if you\u2019ve done the work on structure, and know how\nand why your story works, no matter how they tinker , your screenplay will\nremain strong.\nIt will remain yours.\nNot to get too self-protective, but a strong structure guarantees your\nwriting credit. More than any other element, the bones of a screenplay , as\nconstructed in the story beats of your script, will be proof to those who\ndecide who gets credit at the Writers Guild of America (WG A) that the\nwork is primaril y yours. Talk to any writer whose credit has been arbitrated\nand they\u2019ll tell you. For a spec screenwriter , your guarantee that you stay in\nthe pictu re, and that the fabulou s cash and prizes called residuals  \u2014 which\ncome in lovely lime green envelopes at the most unexpected (and welcome)\ntimes \u2014 will be yours.\nThe craftsmansh ip it takes, the patient work, the magic of storytelling\non film, all come together in how you execute and realize structure. It is a\nskill you must  know .\nI came to structure slowly and late. And mostly I came to it out of\ndesperation. How many meeting s did I go to early on where I pitched my\nmovie idea by giving the exec the concept, a few \u201ccool\u201d scenes, and then\nsimply stopped and smiled\u2026 because I had nowhere else to go? Gad! I\nremember the first time I was hired to write a screenplay and the executive\nasked me about my \u201cAct Break .\u201d I had exactly zero idea of what this nice\nperson was talking about. This was before I\u2019d even heard about Syd Field\n(whom I consider to be the father of the modern movie template ), and when\nI finally read and digested Field\u2019s opus Screenplay , I knew I had found\nsomething truly career -saving.\nOh! Three acts! Imagine that?\nAnd yet, it was not enough. Like a swimmer in a vast ocean, there was\na lot of open water in between those two Act Breaks. And a lot of empty\nscript space in which to get lost, panic, and drown. I needed more islands,\nshorter swims.\nViki King filled in a lot more of that open water for me in a book with\nthe unlik ely \u201cGet Rich Quick\u201d title of How to Write a Movie in 21 Days .\nAnd yet, even with midpoints and B stories, there was still way too much\nroom to screw up.\nSo I developed my own.\nFrom what I\u2019d seen in movies, read about in screenplay books, and\nfound myself relying on, I deve loped the Blake Snyder Beat Sheet. I wrote\nout 15 beats and managed to squeeze them all in on a one-pag e document\non which the fifteen islands would fit \u2014 flush left.\nIt looks like this:\nTHE BLAKE SNYDER BEA T SHEET\nPROJECT TITLE:\nGENRE:\nDATE:\n \n1. Opening Image (1):\n2. Theme Stated (5):\n3. Set-up (1-10):\n4. Catalyst (12):\n5. Debate (12-25):\n6. Break into T wo (25)\n7. B Story (30):\n8. Fun and Games (30-55):\n9. Midpoint (55):\n10. Bad Guys Close In (55-75):\n11. All Is Lost (75):\n12. Dark Night of the Soul (75-85):\n13. Break into Three (85):\n14. Finale (85-1 10):\n15. Final Image (1 10):\nIsn\u2019t this pure? And easy?\nI use this simple one-page blank form whenever I have a pitch\nmeeting. I won\u2019 t let myself go into that meeting until I\u2019ve filled in every\nspace \u2014 and there aren\u2019 t that many spaces. You can only write one, maybe\ntwo sentences explaining what each beat is, and that\u2019s perfect. Like the one-\nline description of the movie as a whole, I learned that if I can\u2019t fill in the\nblank in one or two sentences \u2014 I don\u2019t have the beat yet! I am just\nguessing. I am treading water , about to drown. Yet it isn\u2019t until I work on\nthe form, and try to fill in those blank spaces, that I even know I have a\nproblem!\nThe numbers in parentheses are the page numbers where the beats take\nplace. A script in terms of page  count should be about as long as a good\njockey weighs: 110. Though some dramas run longer , the proportions  are\nthe same . I want my act breaks,  midpoints, and All Is Lost moments to hit\ntheir marks. And I insist they do. Take a look at Blank Check  where, five\nminutes into the movie, roughly page 5 of the script, the them e is stated\nloud and clear . Look at where the midpoint, the All Is Lost, and break into\nthree hit. They\u2019r e perfect, and stayed that way from script to screen because\nColby and I worked our butts off to make it so from the first draft of that\nscript to the last. It worked because our structure was sound and we had\ntried it from every angle to make sure it was sound; it defied those who\nwanted to overwrite us, because we had nailed the structure.\nSome of these terms may be unfamiliar to you. What, you may ask, is\n\u201cfun and games\u201d? Well that\u2019s my name for it. And not to worr y, it\u2019s found\nin both dramas and comedies. What is the \u201cDark Night of the Soul\u201d? Again,\nanother \u201cEureka!\u201d But a beat you\u2019ve seen about a million times.\nThe codifying of these beats is now available to you anytime. The\nBlake Snyder Beat Sheet (The BS2) is here to help. But before you go off\nhalf-baked, or all-baked for that matter , let me explain and give examples of\nwhat I mean by each section of the screenplay as outlined in this form.\nDo you have a choice in this matter?\nNo, you do not!\nOPENING IMAGE (1)\nThe very first impression of what a movie is \u2014 its tone, its mood, the\ntype and scope of the film \u2014 are all found in the opening image. I can think\nof many great ones: the reckless motorcycle ride through the English\ncountryside leading to the death  of Lawr ence of Arabia ; the gated, looming\ncastle behind which lurks the mysterious Citizen Kane ; and even silly ones\nlike the opening image of Animal House  \u2014 who could forget the motto of\nFaber College: \u201cKnowledge is good \u201d beneath the statue of the Faber\nCollege founder? Don\u2019 t we know what we\u2019re in for with all three of these\nexamples? Don\u2019 t each of these opening images set the tone, type, style, and\nstakes of the movie as a whole?\nThe opening image is also an opportunity to give us the starting point\nof the hero. It gives us a moment to see a \u201cbefore\u201d snapshot of the guy or\ngal or group of people we are about to follow on this adventu re we\u2019re all\ngoing to take. Presumably , if the screenwriter has done his job, there will\nalso be an \u201cafter\u201d snapshot to show how things have changed. Like many of\nthe beats on the BS2, the opening image has a matching beat: the final\nimage. These are bookends. And because a good screenplay is about\nchange, these two scenes are a way to make clear how that change takes\nplace in your movie. The opening and final images should be opposites, a\nplus and a minus, showing chan ge so dramatic it documents the emotional\nupheaval that the movie represe nts. Often actors will only read the first and\nlast 10 pages of a script to see if that drastic change is in there , and see if\nit\u2019s intriguing. If you don\u2019t show that change, the script is often tossed\nacross the room into the \u201cReject\u201d pile.\nSo the opening image does a lot. It sets the tone, mood, and style of the\nmovie, and very often introdu ces the main character and shows us a\n\u201cbefore\u201d snapsh ot of him or her. But mostly what it does is get us to\nscrunch down in our seats in the movie theater and say: \u201cThis is gonna be\ngood!\u201d And since you\u2019ve just screened a dozen movies like the one you\u2019re\nabout to write, you can think of at least six that have stando ut opening\nimages. All good movies have them.\nTHEME ST ATED (5)\nSomewhere in the first five minutes of a well-structured screenplay ,\nsomeone (usually not the main chara cter) will pose a question or make a\nstatement (usually to the main character) that is the theme of the movie. \u201cBe\ncareful what you wish for,\u201d this person will say or \u201cPride goeth before a\nfall\u201d or \u201cFamily  is more important than money .\u201d It won\u2019 t be this obvious, it\nwill be conversational, an offhand remark that the main character doesn\u2019 t\nquite get at the moment \u2014 but which will have far-reaching and meaningful\nimpact later .\nThis statement is the movie\u2019 s thematic pr emise .\nIn many ways a good screenplay is an argument posed by the\nscreenwriter , the pros and cons of living a particular kind of life, or\npursuing a particular goal. Is a behavior , dream, or goal worth  it? Or is it\nfalse? What is more important, wealth or happiness?\n\u201cHe who has the gold makes the rules!\u201d Preston\u2019 s lunkhead brother\ntells him, and that\u2019 s the Theme Stated in the first five minutes of Blank\nCheck . Is the statement true? That\u2019 s what the movie will debate.\nWho is greater in the overall scheme of things \u2014 the individual or the\ngroup? And the rest of the screenplay is the argument laid out, either\nproving or disproving this statement, and looking at it, pro and con, from\nevery angle. Whether you\u2019re writing a comedy , a drama, or a sci-fi monster\npicture, a good movie has to be \u201cabout something.\u201d And the place to stick\nwhat your movie is about is right up front. Say it! Out loud. Right there.\nIf you don\u2019t have a movie that\u2019s about something, you\u2019re in trouble.\nStrive to figure out what it is you\u2019re trying to say. Maybe you won\u2019 t know\nuntil your first draft is done. But once you do know , be certain that the\nsubject is raised right up front \u2014 page 5 is where I always put it.\nBut make sure it\u2019 s there. It\u2019 s your opening bid.\nDeclare: I can prove it. Then set out to do so.\nSET-UP (1-10)\nThe first 10 pages of the script,  or first dozen pages at most, is called\nthe \u201cset- up.\u201d If you\u2019re like me, and like most readers in Hollyw ood, this is\nthe make-or -break section where you have to grab me or risk losing my\ninterest. Think of all the good set-ups you\u2019ve seen in the first reel \u2014 the\nfirst ten minutes \u2014 which \u201csets up\u201d the hero, the stakes, and goal of the\nstory\u2026 and does so with vigor!\nThe set-up is also the place where, if you\u2019re me the writer , I make sure\nI\u2019ve introduced or hinted at introducing every character in the A story .\nWatch any good  movie and see. Within the first 10 minutes you meet or\nreference them all. Make sure by your page 10 you have done the same.\nThe first 10 pages is also where we start to plant every character tic,\nexhibit every behavior that needs to be addressed later on, and show how\nand why the hero will need to change in order to win. She\u2019s an isolated\nwriter who lives in a make-believe world ( Romancing the Stone ); he\u2019s a hip,\nslick, and savvy foreign-car importer who\u2019 s as glib as he is cold (Rain\nMan); she\u2019s a ditzy airhead who doesn\u2019t appear to have much substance\n(Legally Blonde ).\nAnd when there\u2019 s something that our hero wants or is lacking, this is\nthe place  to stick the Six Things That Need Fixing . This is my phrase, six\nis an arbitrary number , that stands for the laundry list you must show \u2014\nrepeat SHOW \u2014 the audience of what is missing in the hero\u2019s life. Like\nlittle time bombs, these Six Things That Need Fixing, these character tics\nand flaws, will be exploded later in the script, turned on their heads and\ncured. They will become running gags  and call-backs . We, the audience,\nmust know why they\u2019re being called back! Look at Big and its primary set-\nup: \u201cYou have to be this tall to go on this ride.\u201d On the list of Six Things\nThat Need Fixing there are other needs besides a height requirement. The\nkid in Big can\u2019t get the girl, have any privacy, etc. But in Act Two he gets\nall those things when he magically turns Big. And those call-backs only\nwork because we have seen them in the set-up.\nJeez, but that\u2019s a lot of stuff to do in the first 10 pages! But there it is.\nIf you want to play with the Big boys, these are the tasks you must\naccomplish.\nOne last word on the set-up as it relates to Act One. I like to think of\nmovies as divided into three separate worlds. Most people call these three\nacts, I call \u2019em thesis , antithesis , and synthesis . The first 10 pages and the\nrest of Act One is the movie\u2019 s thesis; it\u2019s where we see the world as it is\nbefore the adventure starts. It is a full-fledged documentation of the hero\u2019 s\nworld labeled \u201cbefore.\u201d There is a calm before the storm in this world, and\nespecially in the set-up. If even ts that follow did not occur , it would pretty\nmuch stay this way. But there is a sense in the set-up that a storm\u2019 s about to\nhit, because for things to stay as they are\u2026 is death. Things must  change.\nCATALYST (12)\nThe package that arrives in Romancing the Stone  which will send Joan\nWilder (Kathlee n Turner) to South America; the telephone call that informs\nTom Cruise his father has died in Rain Man; the dinner at which Reese\nWitherspoon\u2019 s fianc\u00e9 announces he\u2019s dumping her in Legally Blonde  \u2014\nthese are the catalyst moments: telegrams, getting fired, catching the wife in\nbed with anothe r man, news that you have three days to live, the knock at\nthe door, the messenger . In the set-up you, the screenwriter , have told us\nwhat the world is like and now in the catalyst moment you knock it all\ndown. Boom!\nI frankly love the catalyst mom ent, and I really miss it when I don\u2019t\nsee it done, or done well. Have  to have it. Like my pet peeve \u2014 the lack of\ndecent Save the Cat scenes in hip, slick movies \u2014 this is another one that\nbugs me when it\u2019s not there. I like the catalyst moment because \u2014 it\u2019s life.\nThose moments  happen to all of us. And life-changing events often come\ndisguised as bad news. Like many of the beats in the BS2, the catalyst is not\nwhat it seems. It\u2019s the opposite of good news, and yet, by the time the\nadventure is over , it\u2019s what leads the hero to happiness.\nWhen I\u2019m writing a screenplay , my catalyst moment will float around\nfor the first couple of drafts. The set-up will be too long, the story is\nclogged with details, and that page 12 catalyst beat is somehow ,\nmysteriously , on page 20. Well, cut it down and put it where  it belongs:\npage 12. And when you start trimming all your darlings away, you\u2019ll\nsuddenly realize  that\u2019s why we have these little structure maps  \u2014 all that\nboring detail was redundant or you weren\u2019 t very good about  showing it\neconomically . The catalyst point is the first moment when something\nhappens! Thank  God! And if it\u2019s not there, the reader will get antsy . Your\ncoverage will read: \u201cNo Plot\u201d because you\u2019ll have lost the reader \u2019s\nattention. Page 12 \u2014 Catalyst. Do it.\nDEBA TE (12-25)\nThis is a section of the script, between pages 12 and 25, that used to\nreally baffle me. When the telegram comes on page 12 informing me that\nmy sister is being held by pirates, I know what I have to do! So why do I,\nthe writer, have to vamp to the Act Break until my hero does what he\u2019s\nsupposed to?\nThe debate section is just that \u2014 a debate. It\u2019s the last chance for the\nhero to say: This is crazy . And we need him or her to realize that. Should I\ngo? Dare I go? Sure, it\u2019s dange rous out there, but what\u2019 s my choice? Stay\nhere?\nMy writing partner Sheldon Bull and I have been working on our\nGolden Fleece movie. In Act One, a kid is kicked out of military school and\nsent home to find\u2026 his parents have moved. Well, the kid\u2019s stuck. He can\u2019t\ngo back to military school and he can\u2019t stay where he is. He knows where\nhis parents moved to, so now it\u2019s a decision: Should he go on the road to\nfind them ? This is our chance to show how daunting a feat this is going to\nbe. Can you imagine? But since it\u2019s a comedy , we\u2019ve also made it funny .\nOur kid hero is taken to the edge of town at the end of Act One by a\nfriendly cabbie. The kid looks ahead to a spooky-looking road down which\nhe knows he must travel if he is to find his folks. Gulp!  But his fear is\nquickly made light of when he\u2019s heckled by a driver passing by. And so, on\na fun note, and making a firm decision, of f he goes.\nYour moment of truth may not be so clear -cut, but it\u2019s important to\nremember that the debate section must ask a question of some kind. In\nLegally Blonde  the catalyst of the fianc\u00e9 dumping Elle Woods quickly\nsegues to her solution: Go to Harvard Law. \u201cBut can she get in?\u201d That is the\nquestion posed in the debate section of that movie. The debate section thus\nbecomes showin g how Elle answers that question. And when she manages\nto zoom  her LSATs, create a lascivious admissions video, and get accepted,\nthe answ er to the question is clear: Yes! And like the kid hero in our \u201cHome\nAlone  on the road\u201d movie, Elle can happily march into Act Two. She has\nanswered the debate question and can now proceed.\nBREAK INT O TWO (25)\nIt happe ns on page 25. I have been in many arguments. Why not page\n28? What\u2019 s wrong with 30? Don\u2019 t. Please.\nIn a 1 10 page screenplay , it happens no later than 25.\nPage 25 is the place where I always go to first in a screenplay someone\nhas hand ed me (we all have our reading quirks) to see \u201cwhat happens on\n25.\u201d I want to know 1) if anything happens and 2) if this screenwriter\nknows that something should  happen. And I mean something big.\nBecause that\u2019 s what is supposed to happen\u2026 on 25.\nAs discussed above, the act break is the moment where we leave the\nold world, the thesis statement, behind and proceed into a world that is the\nupside down version of that, its antithesis. But because these two worlds are\nso distinct, the act of actually stepping into Act T wo must be definite.\nVery often when I am writing a screenplay , my act break will start off\nvaguely . I\u2019ll find that events will draw the hero into Act Two. This is\nincorrect. The hero cannot be lured, tricked, or drift into Act Two. The hero\nmust make the decision himself . That\u2019 s what makes him a hero anyway \u2014\nbeing proactive. Take Star Wars. The event that prompts Luke Skywalker\non his journey is his parents being killed, but the decision to \u201cgo on the\nroad\u201d is his. Luke cannot wake up on Han Solo\u2019 s starship wondering how\nhe got there, he has to choose to go. Make sure your hero does likewise.\nB ST ORY (30)\nThe B story begins on page 30. And the B story of most screenplays is\n\u201cthe love story .\u201d It is also the story that carries the theme of the movie. I\nalso think that the start of the B story , what takes place around page 30, is a\nlittle booster r ocket  that helps smooth over the shockingly obvious A story\nact break. Think about it. You\u2019ve set up the A story , you\u2019ve put it into\nmotion, now we\u2019ve had this abrupt jump into Act Two and you\u2019ve landed in\na whole new world. The B story says: \u201cEnough already , how about talking\nabout something  else!\u201d Which is why the cutaway is usually in line with the\nA story\u2026 but new in scope.\nThe B story gives us a breather .\nLet\u2019s take Legally Blonde , for instance. The B story is Elle\u2019 s\nrelationship with the manicurist she meets in Boston. And it is a much\nneeded break from the A story . We\u2019ve met Elle. She\u2019s been dumped. She\u2019s\ndecided to go to Law School. She gets there. And school is tough. Well,\nenough already , let\u2019s have a little time-out! Let\u2019s go slightly off theme here\nand meet someone new. Thus, the manicurist. And yes, while it is not a\ntraditional boy-g irl love story , it is in fact \u201cthe love story .\u201d It\u2019s where Elle\nwill be nurtured. It is also the place where Elle confides what she is learning\nin the School of Hard Knocks she\u2019 s experiencing at Harvard Law \u2014 and the\nplace from whic h she\u2019ll draw the strength she needs for the final push into\nAct Three and ultimate victory .\nThe B story is also very often a brand new bunch of characters. We\nhave not always met the B story players in the first 10 pages of the\nscreenplay . We did not even know they existed. But since Act Two is the\nantithesis, they are the upside  down versions of those characters who\ninhabit the world  of Act One. Again, the B story ally in Legally Blonde  is a\nperfect example. Isn\u2019t Jennifer Coolidge, the wonderful actress who\nportrays manicurist Paulette Bonafont\u00e9, the funhouse mirror version of the\ngirls from Elle\u2019 s sorority house back at UCLA? This is why the character is\nso successful. She is a classic anti-thesis creature.\nThe B story then does a lot. And you must have one. It provides not\nonly the love story and a place to openly discuss the theme of your movie,\nbut gives the writer the vital \u201ccutaways\u201d from the A story . And it starts on\n30.\nFUN AND GAMES (30-55)\nThe fun and games section is that part of the screenplay that, I like to\nsay, provides: The pr omise of the pr emise . It is the core and essence of the\nmovie\u2019 s poster . It is where most of the trailer moments of a movie are\nfound. And it\u2019s where we aren\u2019 t as concerned with the forward progress of\nthe story \u2014 the stakes won\u2019 t be raised until the midpoint \u2014 as we are\nconcerned with having \u201cfun.\u201d The fun and games section answers the\nquestion: Why did I come to see this movie? What about this premise, this\nposter , this movie idea, is cool? When you, the development exec, ask for\n\u201cmore set pieces,\u201d this is where I put them. In the fun and games.\nThis, to me, is the heart of the movie. When I discovered what this\nsection of the screenplay needs to do, and why it\u2019s there, it leapfrogged me\nahead 10 places. For me it happ ened in the summer of 1989. And it was a\ndefinite \u201cHazzah !\u201d moment that is rarely so clear . When I was writing my\nvery first draft of Stop or My Mom  Will Shoot!  I was sort of stuck. I had this\ngreat premise, which was: \u201cDirty Harry  gets a new partner \u2014 his mother .\u201d\nBut what was that? What was that movie about? What were the dynamics of\nthe comedy? (Many of you I\u2019m sure are still asking.) Then one day I was\nsitting up in my office in the Fithian Building in Santa Barbara, California,\nand I had a great idea: the world\u2019s slowest chase! What if Joe the cop and\nhis Mom are shot at by bad guys? And what if they give chase. But what if,\ninstead of Joe jumping behind the wheel and driving \u2014 his Mom does. And\nshe drives like a Mom, complete with holding her arm across Joe\u2019s chest\nwhen they stop at all the stop signs. When I sold my script and went to my\nfirst meeting at Universal, the executive told me that when he read that\nscene, that\u2019s when he decided to buy my script. Why? Because that\u2019s when\nhe knew  there was something to this idea. I had delivered on the promise of\nthe prem ise. And where did I put that great set piece? Right where it\nbelonged \u2014 in the fun and games section of the screenplay .\nThis goes for drama as well. The fun and games in Die Hard show\nBruce Willis first outwitting the terrorists. The fun and games in Phone\nBooth  occur when Colin Farrell realizes the seriousness of his predica ment.\nWe take a break from the stakes of the story and see what the idea is about;\nwe see the promise of the premise and need not see anything else. I also call\nit fun and games because this section is lighter in tone than other sections.\nSo Jim Carrey gets to walk around and act like God in Bruce Almighty . And\nTobey Maguire gets to try out his oddly onanistic super powers in Spider -\nMan. It\u2019s also where the buddies in all buddy movies do their most clashing.\nGet it?\nFun and games.\nLearn it, love it, live it.\nMIDPOINT (55)\nThere are two halves in a movie script and the midpoint on page 55 is\nthe thres hold between them. We can talk about the importance  of the two\nact breaks, but to me the midpoint is as important, especially in the early\ngoing of laying out a script\u2019 s beats. I have found, in reviewing hundreds of\nmovies, that a movie\u2019 s midpoint is either an \u201cup\u201d where the hero seemingly\npeaks (though it is a false peak) or a \u201cdown\u201d when the world collapses all\naround the hero (though it is a false collapse), and it can only get better\nfrom here on out. When you decide which midpoint your script  is going to\nrequire, it\u2019s like nailing a spike into a wall good and hard. The clothesline\nthat is your story can now be strung securely .\nI made the disco very of how important this midpoint moment is quite\nby accident. In the early days of my movie-writing career , I used to\naudiotape movie s so I could listen to them in my car when I drove back and\nforth to meeting s between Santa Barbara and L.A. The bargain-basement\ntapes I bought (I was dead flat broke at the time) had 45 minu tes on each\nside. By coincidence, the drive between Santa Barbara and Los Angeles is\ndivided evenly by a mountain overpass at exactly the midpoint of the drive.\nForty-five minutes from starting  each trip, as I hit the top of that hill, side A\nof each tape ended and I had to turn it over to the other side. One night I\ntaped the old comedy classic What\u2019 s Up, Doc? , direct ed by Peter\nBogdanovich and starring Ryan O\u2019Neal and Barbra Streisa nd. And I\ndiscovered, the next day as I topped the mountain crest, that the movie was\nperfectly , evenly divided into two halves and that its midp oint was a\n\u201cdown.\u201d\nThe first half of What\u2019 s Up, Doc?  ends as fire envelops O\u2019Neal\u2019 s hotel\nroom. A slow fade brings us to the next day, as he wakes up a broken man,\nand finds\u2026 Barbra Streisand waiting to help him \u2014 the fire was, after all,\nher fault! Imagine the revelatio n I experienced as I topped the mountain\npass and the first half of What\u2019 s Up, Doc?  that I had taped came to an end.\nThe movie had two even halve s! The power and the purpose of a strong\nmidpoint was forever clear to me.\nWhat can we learn from creaky old movies? Lots. For example, the\nclassic midpoint as R yan O\u2019Neal and Barbra Streisand share the nadir\nmoment in What\u2019 s Up, Doc?\nAfter that I began to see how many movies had midpoints that changed\nthe whole dynamic of the film. But the midpoint does more than present an\n\u201cup\u201d or \u201cdown.\u201d You will hear the phrase \u201cthe stakes are raised  at the\nmidpoint\u201d in a lot of script meetings. Because they are. It\u2019s the point where\nthe fun and games are over. It\u2019s back to the story! It\u2019s also the point where if\nyou have a \u201cfalse victory\u201d where, say, the hero has been given an Out-of-\nthe-Bottle bit of magic, he gets everything he thinks he wants. But it\u2019s a\nfalse victory because the hero has a ways to go before he learns the lesson\nhe really needs. It just seems  like everything\u2019 s great.\nThe midpoint has a matching beat in the BS2 on Page 75 called \u201cAll Is\nLost,\u201d which is described as \u201cfalse defeat.\u201d These two points are a set. It\u2019s\nbecause the two beats are the inverse of each other . The rule is: It\u2019s never as\ngood as it seems to be at the midpoint and it\u2019s never as bad as it seems at\nthe All Is Lost point. Or vice versa! In the What\u2019 s Up, Doc?  example, Ryan\nO\u2019Neal actually wins the coveted prize at the All Is Lost mom ent on page\n75. But it is a false victory , tainted by the rogue\u2019 s gallery of crooks\ndescending on the awards ceremony , and setting the action of Act Three\ninto motion. The midpoint and All Is Lost moments of What\u2019 s Up, Doc?\nrepresent those for a \u201cdown\u201d midpoint. The midpoint is either false victory\nor false defeat, and the All Is Lost is the opposite of it.\nDon\u2019 t believe me?\nCheck out the movies you rented in your genre and see if this\nmidpoint-All Is Lost axis isn\u2019 t in every single one.\nBAD GUYS CLOSE IN (55-75)\nThe section of script from page 55 to page 75, the midpoint to the All\nIs Lost, is the toughest part of the screenplay . (There\u2019 s a hard bit of truth for\nyou!) It never fails to be the most challenging for me, and there\u2019 s no method\nto get through it other than to just to muscle your way .\nThis is where your skills as a bullhead come in handy!\nThe term \u201cBad Guys Close In\u201d applies to the situation the hero finds\nhimself in at midpoint. All seems fine, but even though the bad guys \u2014 be\nthey people, a phenomenon, or a thing \u2014 are temporarily defeated, and the\nhero\u2019 s team seems to be in perfect sync, we\u2019re not done yet. This is the\npoint where the bad guys decide  to regroup and send in the heavy artillery .\nIt\u2019s the point where internal dissent, doubt, and jealousy begin to\ndisintegrate the hero\u2019 s team.\nI\u2019ve never had an easy time with Bad Guys Close In. It\u2019s the weakest\npart of Blank Check , and Colby and I were convinced at the time that it was\nfatal to our story. While writing a teen comedy called Really Mean Girls\nwith Sheldon Bull, we had a similarly hard time with this section. (Not to\nmention the fact that we didn\u2019 t know Tina Fey was writing Mean Girls\nalready!) In our very similar story , four underdog girls decide to fight back\nagainst the evil blonde Alpha females in their high school. By midpoint\nthey have \u201cout-bitched\u201d them, sent the mean girls packing, and become the\nsuperior clique in school. W ell, now what? Sheldon and I didn\u2019 t have a clue.\nWe answ ered that question, after a lot of painful think time, by going\nback to the basics. The evil girls naturally re-group. We even wrote a very\nfunny scene where we see them  do that. Then internal dissent  among our\nheroes begins. Popularity starts to go to their heads, each begins to take\ncredit for their victory , and the question of who is the most popular divides\nthem. By All Is Lost, it\u2019s the reverse of the way it is at midpoin t \u2014 the evil\ngirls resume their \u201crightful\u201d place, and our heroes depart the field in shame.\nAll is really  lost.\nThat simple dynamic took us weeks to figure out. It only seems\nobvious now . Until we solved it, we didn\u2019 t know .\nThat is a classi c example of what should happen in the Bad Guys\nClose In section of any script. The forces that are aligned again st the hero,\ninternal and external, tighten their grip. Evil is not giving up, and there is\nnowhere for the hero to go for help. He is on his own and must endure. He\nis headed for a huge fall, and that brings us to\u2026\nALL IS LOST (75)\nAs addre ssed above, the All Is Lost point occurs on page 75 of a good,\nwell-structured screenplay . We know it is the opposite of the midpoint in\nterms of an \u201cup\u201d or a \u201cdown.\u201d It\u2019s also the point of the script most often\nlabeled \u201cfalse defeat,\u201d for even though all looks black, it\u2019s just temporary .\nBut it seems like a total defeat. All aspects of the hero\u2019 s life are in\nshambles. W reckage abounds. No hope.\nBut here\u2019s my little trade secret that I put into every All Is Lost\nmoment just for added spice, and it\u2019s something that many hit movies have.\nI call it the whiff of death .\nI started  to notice how many great movies use the All Is Lost point to\nkill someone. Obi Wan in Star Wars is the best example \u2014 what will Luke\ndo now? ? All Is Lost is the place where mentors go to die, presumably so\ntheir students can discover \u201cthey had it in them all along.\u201d The mentor \u2019s\ndeath clears the way to prove that.\nBut what if you don\u2019t have an Obi Wan character? What if death isn\u2019t\nanywhere near your story? Doesn\u2019 t matter . At the All Is Lost moment, stick\nin something, anything that involves a death. It works every time. Whether\nit\u2019s integral to the story or just something symbolic, hint at something dead\nhere. It could be anything. A flower in a flower pot. A goldfish. News that a\nbeloved aunt has passed away . It\u2019s all the same. The reason is that the All Is\nLost beat is the \u201cChrist on the cross\u201d moment. It\u2019s where the old world, the\nold character , the old way of thinking dies. And it clears the way for the\nfusion of thesis \u2014 what was \u2014 and antithesis \u2014 the upside down version\nof what was \u2014 to become synthesis, that being a new world, a new life.\nAnd the thing you show dying, even a goldfish, will resonate and make that\nAll Is Lost moment all the more poignant.\nYou\u2019d be surpris ed where this truism shows up. In the comedy hit Elf,\nstarring Will Ferrell, the filmm akers stick exactly to the BS2 and there is\neven a moment where the whif f of death is clearly seen.\nWill Ferrell senses the \u201cwhif f of death\u201d as he contemplates suicide in\nthe All Is Lost moment of Elf.\nIn that story , about a human (Will) raised as an elf in Santa Claus\u2019 s\nNorth Pole, Will comes to New York to find his \u201creal dad,\u201d James Caan.\nThe hilarious upside-down world of Act Two includes a classic anti-thesis\ncharacter , Will\u2019s love interest, who is working as a \u201cfake\u201d elf in a\ndepartment store at Christmas time. But later, when it all goes to hell one\nnight for poor Will, when his real father rejects him and the world gets too\ncomplicated, we even have a death moment at page 75. Will pauses on a\ncity bridge and, looking out at the water waaaay below , clearly\ncontemplates suicide. When I saw this film in the theater I practi cally yelled\nout \u201cSee! Whif f of death!\u201d but managed to restrain myself. And yet, there it\nwas, plain as day .\nTake a look at your dozen movies you\u2019ve screened and find the All Is\nLost point. Does  it have the whiff of death in some aspect? Most certainly it\nwill. All good, primal stories must have this. It resonates for a reason.\nDARK NIGHT OF THE SOUL (75-85)\nSo now you\u2019re in the middle of a death moment at the All Is Lost\npoint, but how does your character experiencing this moment feel about it?\nThis question is answered in a section of the screenplay I call Dark Night of\nthe Soul. It can last five seconds or five minutes. But it\u2019s in there. And it\u2019s\nvital. It\u2019s the point, as the name suggests, that is the darkness right before\nthe dawn. It is the point just before the hero reaches way, deep down and\npulls out that last, best idea that will save himself and everyone around him.\nBut at the moment, that idea is nowhere in sight.\nI don\u2019t know why we have to see this moment, but we do. It\u2019s the \u201cOh\nLord, why hast thou forsaken me?\u201d beat. I think it works because, once\nagain, it\u2019s primal. We\u2019ve all been there \u2014 hopeless, clueless, drunk, and\nstupid \u2014 sitting on the side of the road with a flat tire and four cents, late\nfor the big appointment that will save our lives. Then and only then, when\nwe admit our humility and our humanity , and yield our control of events\nover to Fate, do we find the solution. We must be beaten and know it to get\nthe lesson.\nThe Dark Night of the Soul is that point. It\u2019s in comedies and dramas\nbecause it\u2019s real and we all identify . And in a good, well-structured\nscreenplay , it\u2019s in there between  pages 75 and 85. And thank God, because\nby page 85, when the hero finally figures it out, we get to see him realize\u2026\nBREAK INT O THREE (85)\n\u2026 Hazzah! The solution!\nThanks to the characters found in the B story (the love story), thanks to\nall the conversations discussing theme in the B story , and thanks to the\nhero\u2019 s last best effort to discov er a solution to beat the bad guys who\u2019ve\nbeen closing in and winning in the A story , lo! the answer is found!!\nBoth in the external story (the A story) and the internal story (the B\nstory), which now meet and intertwine, the hero has prevailed, passed every\ntest, and dug deep to find the solution. Now all he has to do is apply it.\nThe classic fusion of A and B is the hero getting the clue from \u201cthe\ngirl\u201d that makes him realize how to solve both \u2014 beating the bad guys and\nwinning the heart of his beloved.\nAn idea to solve the problem has emer ged.\nThe world of synthesis is at hand.\nFINALE (85-1 10)\nThe finale is Act Three. This is where we wrap it up. It\u2019s where the\nlessons learned are applied. It\u2019s where the character tics are mastered. It\u2019s\nwhere A story and B story end in triumph for our hero. It\u2019s the turning over\nof the old world and a creation of a new world order \u2014 all thanks to the\nhero, who leads the way based on what he experienced in the upside-down,\nantithetical world of Act T wo.\nThe finale entails the dispatchi ng of all the bad guys, in ascending\norder . Lieutenan ts and henchman die first, then the boss. The chief source\nof \u201cthe problem\u201d \u2014 a person or thing \u2014 must be dispatched completely for\nthe new world order to exist. And again, think of all the examples in the\nmovies you\u2019ve screened of how this is true. The finale is where a new\nsociety is born. It\u2019s not enough for the hero to triumph, he must change the\nworld. The finale is where it happens. And it must be done in an\nemotionally satisfying way .\nFINAL IMAGE (1 10)\nAs stated earlier , the final image in a movie is the opposite of the\nopening image. It is your proof that change has occurred and that it\u2019s real. If\nyou don\u2019t have that final image , or you can\u2019t see how it appli es, go back\nand check your math \u2014 there is something not adding up in Act T wo.\nSUMMAR Y\nSo now that I\u2019ve laid out these 15 beats for you, and used examples\nlike What\u2019 s Up, Doc? , I\u2019m sure all you hip, young screenwriting whipper -\nsnappers are saying, yeah, right  old man. Maybe this applied in your day,\nbut we don\u2019t need it anymore. We eschew the need to \u201clike\u201d a hero (we dig\nLara Croft!!!) and those boring old story beats are pass\u00e9. Who needs \u2019em?\nWhat about Memento !!\nHave I grasped the basic gestalt of your objection?\nExistential dilemmas are what close on Saturday night, as the low-\nperforming art house gem Memento  proves. Gimmick or really dull movie?\nYou decide.\nIf so, and though I\u2019ve tried to pepper my examples with many newer\nmovies, like Legally Blonde , you still may not believe me when I say this\nstuff applies. Still. Always.\nSo for you nay-sayers, who say nay, let me use an example from my\ngenre, PG Comedy , that shows how these beats apply in the modern world\nyou need to master .\nOh, and btw , screw Memento !\nLet\u2019s use a $100 million Box Office (B.O.) hit. Would that satisf y you?\nLet\u2019s look at a great poster and logline, with a great star that satisfies all the\nbeats in the BS2. Let\u2019s take a look at the Sandra Bullock comedy , Miss\nCongenialty .\nTo start, it\u2019s got a great title. And its logline \u2014 an ugly duckling FBI\nagent goes unde rcover as a contestant to catch a killer at the American Miss\npageant \u2014 certainly satisfies the four elements from Chapter One: irony ,\ncompelling picture, audience and cost, and a killer title. Let\u2019s see if it beats\nout according to the BS2?\nMISS CONGENIALITY\n(A $100 million hit comedy in 15 beats)\nOpening Image:  Miss Congeniality  opens on Sandra Bullock\u2019 s\ncharacter in flashback as a playground tough. The image is: Sandra\nsurrounded by boys. Sandra is a tomboy and she\u2019s beating them up. Sandra\nhas issues. When we CUT TO: The Present, Sandra is still surrounded by\nboys, still a tomboy , but she\u2019s an FBI agent, at home in the world of Men \u2014\nkind of.\nTheme Stated:  When Sandra declares that she doesn\u2019 t need to worry\nabout being \u201cfeminine\u201d because  she\u2019s an FBI agent, that statement is the\nmovie\u2019 s theme. But is this statement true? We shall see. The movie will\nexplore the subject of femininity . It is an essay on the pros and cons of\nbeing tough and a wom an. Can you be both? That\u2019 s what this movie is\nabout .\nThe Set-up:  By page  10 we have met everyo ne who will appear in the\nA story of the movie and \u201cset up\u201d the world. We\u2019ve met Benjamin Bratt,\nwhom Sandra kind of likes. But she is off his radar; he likes \u201cclassy\u201d girls\nthat Sandra scoffs at. We also meet Sandra\u2019 s boss (Ernie Hudson) and the\nworld of the FBI. It\u2019s tough, a boy\u2019s club, and Sandra fits right in. And\nthough she is a wheezing nerd with bad hair and no social life, she seems\nhappy \u2014 a classic set-up, with a sense a storm\u2019 s about to hit. It can\u2019t stay\nlike this. Stasis equals death.\nCatalyst:  A classic call to adventure. News comes that there\u2019 s been a\nmurder threat at the American Miss Pageant. We also meet those in charge\nof the pageant, Candice Ber gen and her son, and their \u201cBert Parks,\u201d W illiam\nShatner and his hairpiece \u2014 and a very sporty model it is! To stop the\nmurders, they hatch a plan that calls for a female agent to go undercover as\na contestant. After going throug h a database of every available  female FBI\nagent\u2026 they pick Sandra.\nLet the act break and let the fun and games begin. Ugly duckling\nSandra Bullock looks hot, hot, hot in her miniskirt as she strides into Act\nTwo of Miss Congeniality .\nDebate:  But can she pull it off? That is the debate question of this\nsection. It is answered after several funny moments with Sandra\u2019 s mentor\n(Michael Caine), who agrees to take on the challenge of turning Sandra into\na sexy girl.\nBreak into Two: Sandra strides from her makeover looking hot, hot,\nhot in her mini-skirt. Even Benjamin is impressed. Then she stumbles. This\nisn\u2019t going to be easy, but Sandra is ready to try. So let the act break and\nAct T wo begin!\nFun and Games:  Classic promise of the premise, including all those\nfunny trailer moments where a pistol-packing FBI agent is undercover at\nthe American Miss pageant. Sandra\u2019 s water -glass talent show demonstration\nends as she leaps off the stage to nab a suspect, etc. The fish is out of water\nand the clash leads to jokes. This is why we came to this movie. This is\nwhat lured us when we saw the poster . And it\u2019 s fun!\nB Story:  The love story here is actually between Sandra and the girl\ncontestants. Why? Because the theme of the movie is about femininity and\nSandra does not know this world. It is full of funhouse mirror versions of\nfemininity \u2014 each contestant has a talent and a quirk and each, to Sandra\u2019 s\nsurprise, needs and likes her. It is Sandra\u2019 s interaction with the girls of Girl\nWorld that carries the message of the picture and is its heart. And while\nSandra also gets to kiss Benjam in by the movie\u2019 s end, it will be because of\nthe girls that she learns and grows and discovers her feminine side.\nMidpoint:  The fun and games are over as a new threat to the pageant\nis announced and Sandra\u2019 s stake s are raised. We have seen all the fun stuff\n(Sandra and her water glasses), met the suspects, had the joy of watching a\ntomboy interact with the girls she once thought odd. Now the real trouble\nstarts.\nBad Guys Clos e In: Sandra\u2019 s doubts about her femininity grow , her\nconflict with her mentor deepen s, and, in this case, actual bad guys move\ncloser , unseen in the shadows of the pageant. Though no one has died,\nthere\u2019 s a list of suspects.\nAll Is Lost:  Told by her boss to stand down, Sandra refuses. She has a\nlead on a suspec t. But her boss delivers an ultimatum: Either quit the case\nor be fired. Sandra chooses to stay on at the pageant. Thus, she has reached\na classic All Is Lost moment: She is worse off than when this movie started!\nThe whiff of death is the death of her identity . Without being \u201cthe Girl with\nthe Badge\u201d \u2014 who is she? Not even her mentor (Caine) can help, but he\ndoes give her a last weapon: a new dress.\nDark Night of the Soul:  Sandra arrives for the pageant finale and is a\ntotal mess. She\u2019s lost in the netherworld of being neither FBI agent nor full-\nfledged woman. What to do?\nBreak into Three: With help from  friends she\u2019s made in Girl World,\nSandra is put back together by the other contestants for the pageant finale.\nEmbraced by what was once foreign to her, and confident that the girls\nreally care, Sandra is revived. By helping Sandra, the girls also help\nthemselves.\nFinale:  The pageant itself. A classic bit of synthesis occurs when\nSandra hangs in during the talent portion of her show by using her FBI\nskills on stage with Benjami n. The two worlds are fused together ,\nanswering the question raised in Theme Stated: Yes! She can be both tough\nand sexy. Sandra now catches the bad guys, Candice and her son.\n(Candice\u2019 s warp ed view of her own femininity is what caused her to\nsabotage the pageant.) Sandra has proven herself to be a woman among\nwomen. And she\u2019 s brought the bad guys to justice.\nFinal Image:  Miss Congeniality  closes with the opposite of the\nopening image: Sandra is surrounded by women. Sandra is awarded the\ncoveted Miss Congeniality A ward by her fellows \u2014 quite a change!\nThe Real  Happy Ending:  $100 million in domestic B.O.\nNow that you know that it works, you\u2019ll start to see how these beats\ncan apply to your script.\nEXERCISES\n \n1. Type up the BS2 and carry it with you everywhere. Whenever you\nhave an idle moment, think about a favorite movie. Can the beats of\nthat movie fit into neat, one-sentence descriptions of each of the 15\nblanks?\n2. Go back to Bloc kbuster (boy, are they tired of you by now) and\ncheck out the 6-12 movies in the genre of the movie you\u2019re writi ng. Sit\nand watch as the beats of these films are magically filled into the\nblanks of the BS2.\n3. For extra credit, look at Memento . Yes, it\u2019s an entertaining movie;\nyes, it even falls into the categ ory of genre \u201cDude with a Problem.\u201d\nDoes it also match the beats of the BS2? Or is it just a gimmick that\ncannot be applied to any other movie? HINT : For all the hullabaloo\nsurrounding Memento , guess how much it made?\nAnd if you want to seriously debate the value of Memento  in modern\nsociety , please go ahead and contact me at the e-mail address provided in\nChapter One. But be ready for one hell of an argument from me!! I know\nhow much Memento  made.\nIf we are very lucky we find a guru. These are people we meet along\nthe way that have more wisdom  than we do and, to our surpr ise, offer to\nshare what they know . Mike Cheda is the first guru I met in the\nscreenwriting business and for 20 years he has continued to amaze me with\nhis ability to spot, understand, and fix the problems of any screen story .\nI first met Mike when he was head of development for Barry &\nEnright. Mike also worked in that capacity for Disney and was VP of\nDevelopment at HBO and Once  Upon A Time Productions. Over the years,\nMike has developed hundreds of movie and television projects \u2014 often\nfrom initial conc ept to final cut. He has not only been an executive for these\nand other companies, but is himself a writer (something more development\nexecs should try) whose Chill Factor  starred Cuba Gooding, Jr. and the\nDash Riprock-named Skeet Ulrich.\nNo matter what incarnation Mike Cheda appears under \u2014 executive,\nwriter , or producer \u2014 wherever  he goes, his magic story touch is the stuff\nof legend. Of the many scalps on his belt, Mike is the guy credited with\ncracking the story for the Patrick Swayze movie, Next of Kin . Though it was\na spec script purchase in the million-dollar range, Next of Kin had problems\nthat needed tweaking before it could get a green light \u2014 and it was Mike\nwho solved them. Mike even showed me the place  where this event\noccurred. One day we were takin g a time-out from a story we were trying to\nbreak, bowed by despair and self-loathing over not knowing how. While\nwalking through  Century City, Mike stopped at the hallowed piece of\nsidewalk.\nIt was here, he said, Jacob Bronowski-like, during a similarly\nmeditative walk when his brain was filled with all the wrong ways to fix\nNext of Kin, that he\u2019d come up with the right way. \u201cIt just hit me. Cowboys\nand Indians!\u201d And indeed when  he presented this simple construct to the\nproducers of Next of Kin, that\u2019s exactly what guided the rewrite. In the\ncourse of his career , Mike has had many such moments. Like some String\nTheory physicist, he is always working on perfecting his story skills \u2014\noften in ways that seem otherworldly , but almost always prove to be\ninspired.\nSo when I ran into Mike recently and asked what new ideas he\u2019d come\nup with, he pulled out an artist\u2019 s sketchbook from his satchel and opened it\nwith gleeful enthusiasm. The two halves of the sketchpad, its spiral binding\nrunning down the middle, offered a larger-than-normal field. Across both\npages, he had drawn three straig ht lines, demarcating four horizontal rows.\nAnd in the midd le of these four equal rows were cut-out squar es of paper ,\neach was a beat of the screen story he was working on.\n\u201cIt\u2019s portable,\u201d Mike cackled like a mad scientist.\n\u201cAh!\u201d I said. \u201cThe Board.\u201d\nAnd we both nodded with the respect.\nThe Board.\nCHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD\nThe Board  is perhaps the most vital piece of equipment a screenwriter\nneeds to have at his disposal \u2014 next to paper , pen, and laptop. And over the\nyears, whenever  I\u2019ve walked into someone\u2019 s office and seen one on the\nwall, I have to smile because I now know what it is \u2014 and the migraine-in-\nprogress it denotes. Boards come in all types and sizes: blackboards\nsmeared with chalk, cork boards  with index cards and pushpins  to hold the\nbeats in place, and even pages of a yellow legal pad Scotch-ta ped to hotel\nwalls while on location \u2014 in the attempt to re-work a script on the fly. The\nBoard is universal. And yet of the screenwriting courses I know of, I\u2019ve\nnever really heard this useful tool discussed.\nSo damn it, let\u2019 s talk about it!\nI saw my first one on Mike Cheda\u2019s office wall at Barry & Enright 20\nyears ago. Na\u00eff that I was \u2014 though I\u2019d already been paid actual money to\nwrite a few screenplays \u2014 I\u2019d never seen The Board, nor could I imagine\nwhat it would possibly be used for. Didn\u2019 t you simply sit down and start\nand let the scenes fall where they may? Didn\u2019 t you just\u2026 let \u2018er rip?\nThat\u2019 s what I always did.\nBut thanks to the Chairman of The Board, Mike Cheda, I learn ed not\nonly the vital importance of planning a script by using The Board, but how\nto use it to super charge my results. Since that time I have emplo yed it often.\nIn my case, I use a big corkboar d that I can hang on the wall and stare at. I\nlike to get a pack of index cards and a box of push pins and stick up my\nbeats on The Board, and move  \u2019em around at will. I have many decks of\nthese index cards, rubber banded and filed by project, of scripts written and\nyet-to-be. And all I need to do to revisit any of these scripts is take out the\npack, deal \u2019em up on The Board, take a look to know where I left off \u2014 and\nfigure out if I need to call Mike.\nThe Board is a way for you to \u201csee\u201d your movie before you start\nwriting. It is a way to easily test different scenes, story arcs, ideas, bits of\ndialogue and story rhythms, and decide whether they work \u2014 or if they just\nplain suck. And though it is not really writing, and though your perfect plan\nmay be totally abandoned in the white heat of actually executing your\nscreenplay , it is on The Board where you can work out the kinks of the\nstory before you start. It is your way to visualize a well-plotted  movie, the\none tool I know of that can help you build the perfect beast.\nBut here are the most beneficial things about The Board:\n \n1. It\u2019s tactile and\u2026\n2. It wastes a lot of time!\nThe exercise of working The Board uses things other than your fingers\non a keyboard. Pens, index cards, pushpins. All things you can touch, and\nsee, and play with at will.\nAnd did I mention how much time you can waste doing all this?\nYou can spend a whole afternoon at Staples picking out just the right-\nsized board. You can spend the next morning figuring out where it goes on\nyour wall. You can even go mobile with the index cards. You can pop that\ndeck in your pocket, head out to Starbucks, take the rubber band  off, and sit\nthere and shuffle your cards for hours, laying out scene sequences, set\npieces, and whammies. It\u2019 s great!\nAnd the best part is, while you\u2019re doing all this seemingly ridiculous,\ntime-wasting work, your story is seeping into your subconscious in a whole\nother way. Have a great piece of dialogue? Write it on a card and stick it on\nThe Board where you think it might go. Have an idea for a chase sequence?\nDeal up them cards and take a looksee. And talk about creating a pressure-\nfree zone! No more blank pages. It\u2019s all just little bitty index  card-sized\npages. And who can\u2019 t fill up an index card?\nAll well and good but how does it apply to me? you ask.\nMe! Me! Me!\nAll right, let\u2019 s talk about you and your Board.\nFIRST CARDS FIRST\nOnce you\u2019ve bought the size and type of board you feel most\ncomfortable with, put it up on the wall and have a look. It\u2019s blank, isn\u2019t it?\nNow take three long strips of masking tape and make four equal  rows. Or if\nyou\u2019re more daring, use a magic marker instead. Either way it looks like\nthis:\nRow #1 is Act One (pages 1-25); row #2 represents the first half of Act\nTwo up to the midpoint (25-55) ; row #3 is the midpoint to the Break into\nAct Thre e (55-85); and row #4 is Act Three to the movie\u2019 s final image (85-\n110).\nIt looks so easy, doesn\u2019 t it? Well, it is. That\u2019 s the whole idea. And after\na couple of go-rounds using this tool, it will start to feel familia r, too. Soon,\nlike a slot car racetrack, the corners and open stretches of this imaginary\nconcourse will become well-worn and pleasing geography .\nYou will quickly find that the ends of each row are the hinges of your\nstory . The Break into Two, the midpoint, and the Break into Three are\nwhere the turns are; each appears at the end of rows 1, 2, and 3. To my\nmind, this fits my mental map of what a screenplay is perfectly . And if you\nbuy Syd Field\u2019 s premise that each of the turns spins the story in a new\ndirection, you see exactly where it occurs.\nNow in my hot little hand I also have a crisp, clean, brand new pack of\nindex cards. (Oh, it\u2019s fun to unwrap the cellophane!) And now with the help\nof a fistful of Pentels (not a Clint Eastwo od movie) and my box of multi-\ncolored pushpin s, I\u2019m ready to put up my very first card. To waste as much\ntime as possible, I usually neatly write the title of the movie on one such\ncard and stick it up at the very top and take a step back. In a few weeks, or\nmonths, the Board is going to be covered with little bits of paper , arrows,\ncolor -coding, and cryptic messages. For now , it\u2019s clean.\nEnjoy it while you can, lads.\nOkay . Time to start.\nAlthough you can write anythin g you want on these index cards, they\nare primarily used to denote scenes. By the time we\u2019re done, you\u2019ll have 40\nof these \u2014 count \u2019em, 40 \u2014 and no more. But for now, in this rough stage,\nwe\u2019ll hang loose. Use as many as you want. And if you run out, you get to\ngo back to Staples and waste more time \u2014 so go for it!\nWhat goes on your final 40 is very simple. Each card stand s for a\nscene, so where does the scene take place? Is it an INTERIOR or an\nEXTERIOR? Is it a sequence of scenes like a chase that covers several\nlocations? If you can see it, write it with a magic marker: INT. JOE\u2019S\nAPARTMENT \u2013 DAY. Each card should also include the basic action of the\nscene told in simple declarative sentences. \u201cMary tells Joe she wants a\ndivorce.\u201d More specific inform ation will be noted later. For now, the\naverage beat or scene looks like this:",

    "name": "In any storytellin g venture, the most burning ideas you have for scenes\nare what must be laid out first. These are scenes you\u2019re sure are going to go\ninto your movie . It\u2019s what made you want to write this puppy  in the first\nplace. For me, most often, these are funny set pieces, followed by that great\nscene where we introduce the hero, and maybe the finale. Well, write each\nidea on a card and stick it up on The Board where you think it goes. It may\nwind up in another place or may be cut out, but damn it feels good to get\nthose scenes of f your chest. Y up. They\u2019re up there, all right.\nAnd look at what you have.\nWhat you have is a whole lot of blank space. Gee, aren\u2019 t you glad you\ndidn\u2019 t start writing? All those really great ideas that were burning to be\nwritten don\u2019t feel as big as you thought they were. And the story doesn\u2019 t\nseem so likely to write itself once the ideas are written down and put up on\nThe Board. The great way the movie starts or the chase at the middle or the\ndramatic showdown that felt so full, so easy to execute in your head, isn\u2019t\nall that much stuff when you see it there naked. Up on the board, they\u2019re\njust a small part of the whole. But if you want to see these wond erful scenes\ncome to life \u2014 and have a reason  to live \u2014 work  must be done. Now the\nhard part begins.\nTHE MAJOR TURNS\nThe next cards you really must nail in there are the hinge points  of the\nstory: midpoint, Act Two break, Act One break. Since you have the\nadvantage of the BS2 you know  how vital these are. And even though you\nmay come at it a whole other way, I always try to figure out the major\nturns  first.\nI start with the midpoint. As discussed in the previous chapter , it\u2019s an\n\u201cup\u201d or \u201cdown.\u201d Either your hero (or heroes) reach a dizzyingly false\nvictory at page 55 or an equally false and dizzying defeat. In most cases,\nnailing the midpoint will help guide you \u2014 and it is the one decision you\nmust make before you can go on. Most people can nail the break into Act\nTwo. The set-up you\u2019ve got, and the adventure, or at least the beginning of\nit, is the movie in your head. But where does it go from there? The midpoint\ntells you. And that\u2019 s why figuring it out is so important.\nWith the midpoint nailed, the All Is Lost is not too hard to figure out.\nIt\u2019s the flip of the midpoint. What about the \u201cup\u201d or \u201cdown\u201d of the midpoint\ncan be reversed to create its false opposite? And though it may take you\nsome time to adjust both, give it a try. If you nail these two points, the\nBreak into Three is usually cake. Now your board is starting to flesh itself\nout. It should look more like this:",

    "name": "OVERLOADED ACTS AND BLACK HOLES\nFor me, my biggest problem is mistaking the cards for something other\nthan beats of the story , some thing other than actual scenes. This is\nespecially true in the early going as I lay out the set-up and the action of the\nfirst act. I give myself three or four cards for the first 10 pages,  that\u2019s three\nor four scenes to get me to the catalyst. But a lot of times what I\u2019ll see\nspread out there are seven or eight cards with things like \u201cthe hero is a\nwrongly accused felon\u201d next to \u201cthe hero is a saxophone player .\u201d Well,\nthese are not scenes, this is backstory . And these cards will eventually be\nfolded into one card labeled \u201cMeet the Hero\u201d during an actual scene in\nwhich he walks into a room and we see him for the first time.\nAs stated in the previous chapter , a lot of this backstory , these\ncharacter tics and set-ups need to be\u2026 set up. And all your great ideas will\ngo on cards and just pile up here like BMWs on the 405 at rush hour. Never\nfear, it will all be pared down eventually . Point is to get it all out. This is the\ntime to try anything, think of everything , and stick it all up there to see what\nit looks like.\nMore confusion comes when scene sequences are laid out up on The\nBoard. Though things like \u201ca chase\u201d involve many scenes and can range\nthrough indoor and outdoor set-ups, it\u2019s actually only one beat. So what\nusually happens is you have five, six, seven cards that are a sequence. Well,\nthese will fold into one eventually but for now will look like this:\nOne great part about using The Board is the easy way you can identify\nproblem spots. When you have a black hole \u2014 a place in your script that\nyou can\u2019t figure out how to connect one chunk to another \u2014 you know it,\n\u2019cause it\u2019s staring you right in the face. All you have to do is look at The\nBoard and cry. And believe me, those black holes just sit there and taunt\nyou, hour after hour, day after day. \u201cWhat\u2019 s wrong, Blake? Can\u2019 t figure it\nout? Got a little\u2026 STORY problem?\u201d But at least you know where it is and\nwhat has to be done to fill in the blank spots. You\u2019ve got nine to 10 cards\nper row that you need to fill. And you have to figure it out.\nTHE ETERNALL Y LIGHT ACT THREE\nThe funny part about laying out these cards is: In the early going, you\nalmost always have a light Act Three.\nIt\u2019s usually two cards. One labeled \u201cthe Hero figures out what to do\nnow\u201d and the other labeled \u201cthe Showdown.\u201d\nHa! Kills me every time I see it.\nAnd you always keep putting of f fixing this.\nNot to fear .\nEventually this too will give way. Your mind will flood with ideas and\nAct Three will begin to fill up. If not, then go back to Act One and look at\nall your set-ups and the Six Thin gs That Need Fixing. Are these paid off in\nAct Three?\nIf not, they should be.\nWhat about your B story? Whether it\u2019s the true love story or the\nthematic center of the movie, this must be paid off, too. In fact, the more\nyou think about tying up all the loose ends, the C, D, and E stories,\nrecurring images, themes, etc., the more you realize all the screenplay\nbookkeeping that has to be accounted for in Act Three. Where else can it be\ndone? (What? Y ou gonna pass out pamphlets at the movie theater?)\nAnd what about the bad guys? Did you off all the lieutenants on your\nway to killing the \u00fcber-villain?  Did all of the hero\u2019 s detractors get their\ncomeuppance? Has the world been changed by the hero\u2019 s actions? Soon you\nwill find your Act Three crowded with cards and ideas to fill up the final\nscenes. Nine or 10 cards will be required to do this.\nGuaranteed.\nCOLOR-CODING\nNow here\u2019 s a really cool thing. And it wastes a lot of time! But it\u2019 s also\nimportant. How each characte r\u2019s story unfolds and crosses with others\nneeds to be seen to be successfully worked out. This is where your Pentels\ncome in. Color -code each story . See what Meg\u2019 s story cards look like\nwritten in green ink and Tom\u2019s story cards are like written in red. And when\nyou put them up on The Board, you can see at a glance how the stories are\nwoven together \u2014 or if they need to be re-worked. This is one instance\nwhere you will not know how you lived befor e you used The Board. And\nseeing these beats up there makes you realize what a potential nightmare it\nwould be to try to figure this all out while writing. Screenplays are\nstructure. Preci sely made Swiss clocks of emotion. And seeing your\ndifferent colored stories woven together here makes you realize how vital\nthis planning can be. But color -coding can be used for other things too:\n \n> story points that follow and enhance theme  and repeating\nimagery  can be color -coded.\n> minor character ar cs can be traced with your Pentels.\n> c, d, and e stories  can get the color -code treatment.\nAnd once you have your multi-colored cards in place, you can step\nback and see the genius (!) of your design.\nAll this is intend ed, of course, to ultimately save you time. Wha t could\nbe worse than being in the middle of actually writing your screenplay and\ndealing with these placement questions? It\u2019s a lot easier to see and move\ncards around on a board than chunks of your own writage that you\u2019ve fallen\nin love with. It\u2019s a lot harder to kill your darlings by then. By organizing\nfirst, the writing is more enjoyable.\nSTRIPPING IT DOWN\nForty cards. That\u2019s all I\u2019m going to give you for your finished board.\nThat\u2019 s roughly 10 cards per row. So if you\u2019ve got 50 or if you\u2019ve got 20,\nyou\u2019ve got problems.\nMost likely you will have more than you need. And this is where the\nrubber meets the road, when you must examine each beat and see if the\naction or intent can\u2019t be folded into another scene or eliminated altogether .\nLike I mentioned previously , I usually have problem areas. Set-up is a\nbiggie for me. I have 20 cards sometimes in the first row. I think there is so\nmuch to say, so much I\u2019m not getting across that I overcompensate. But\nthen I look at how these beats can be cut out or folded into others. If I\u2019m\nhonest, if I really admit that I can live without some things, it starts to cut\ndown. I get it down to nine cards.\nAnd that\u2019 s perfect.\nI will also have a lot of sequence s. Like chases or action set pieces that\nstray all over the place. This is easy to fix. Simply write CHA SE on this\nsection, no matter how many scenes, and consider it one beat. Usually that\u2019s\nall it is as far as advancing the plot is concerned.\nIn areas where I\u2019m light, like the problem area of Bad Guys Close In, I\nusually cut myself some slack. And in some spots, where I know I don\u2019t\nhave all the answers, I occasionally even leave it blank and hope for a\nmiracle during the writing process. But in the back of my mind, I know\nthese areas will have to be addressed at some point. Laying it out lets me\nknow where the trouble spots are.\n+/- AND ><\nNow that you have your 40 cards up on The Board and you\u2019re  pretty\nsure this is how your story goes, you think you\u2019re done, but you\u2019re not.\nHere are two really important things you must put on each card and answer\nto your satisfaction before you can begin writing your screenplay:\nOne is the symbol +/-. The other is the symbol ><.\nThese two symbols should be written in a color pen you have not used\nand put at the bottom of each card like this:\nThe +/- sign represents the emotional change you must execute in each\nscene. Think of each scene as a mini-movie. It must have a beginning,\nmiddle, and an end. And it must also have something happen that causes the\nemotional tone to change drasti cally either from + to \u2013 or from \u2013 to + just\nlike the opening  and final images of a movie. I can\u2019t tell you how helpful\nthis is in weeding out weak scenes or nailing down the very real need for\nsomething defin ite to happen  in each one. Example: At the beginning of a\nscene your hero is feeling cocky . He\u2019 s a lawyer and he\u2019 s just won a big case.\nThen his wife enters with news. Now that the case is over, she wants a\ndivorce. Clearly what started as a + emotionally for your lawyer hero is\nnow a \u2013 emotionally .\nBelieve it or not, an emotional change like this must occur in every\nscene. And if you don\u2019t have it, you don\u2019t know what the scene is about.\nUntil you figure out the emotional change for each of the 40 cards using\nthis simple +/- code, don\u2019t start. And if you can\u2019t figure it out, throw the\ncard away . Odds are it\u2019s wrong. And while many , like Robert McKee,\nbelieve these +\u2019s and \u2013\u2019s must be strung together +-/-+/+-/-+/+ - to butt up\nagainst each other in an undulating wave of emotional highs and lows, I\nthink that\u2019s taking it a little far. It\u2019s enough to know something has to\nchange in each scene and to show it.\nThe other symbol, ><, denotes conflict. To understand what the\nconflict is, I always like to think of a scene like this: As the lights come up,\ntwo people walk  into a room from opposite doors, meet in the middle, and\nbegin to struggle past each other to reach the door on the other side. They\neach enter the scene with a goal and standing in their way is an obstacle.\nThat\u2019 s conflict . And whether it\u2019s physical or verbal or simply a guy who\nreally needs to pee and must get to a bathroom soon or else!, that conflict\nmust be foremost on your mind when you conceive each scene. The basic\nset-ups of Man vs. Man, Man vs. Nature, and Man vs. Socie ty that you\nlearned in high-school English class can all be applied here.\nWhen each scene opens, you must know what the main conflict  of that\nscene is and who is bucking against whom. Each person, or entity , has an\nagenda. What is it? And how does it collide with the person or entity he or\nshe must get past? The symbol >< on the bottom of each card must be filled\nin with who each of the players  is in each scene of conflict, what the issue\nis, and who wins by the end. If it\u2019s more than one person or issue, you\u2019ve\ngot a muddy conflict. And your scene is probably muddy , too. Only one\nconflict per scene, please. One is plenty . And whether it\u2019s a large issue or a\nsmall one, something physical or something psychological, it must be there.\nEvery scene. Every time. If you can\u2019t find a conflict, figure out a way to\ncreate one.\nThe reason having conflict is so important and must be in every scene\nis, once again, very primal. (There\u2019 s that word again.) And thinking\nprimally , by having conflict in every scene, guarantees that you will keep\nthe audience\u2019 s attention. Why? Well, we like to see people in conflict.\nConflict gets our attention. Why  is wrestling the longest running drama on\nTV? It\u2019s about as basic an entertainment as you can get: DEATH! Two\npeople trying to kill each other . Why do most movies have a romance?\nAgain, the conflict is eternally primal and fascinating: SEX! Two people\ntrying to bed each other . At its core, every scene in your movie must be as\nbasic as this in order to get and keep the viewer \u2019s attention. If you don\u2019t\nhave the players in the > vs. < match-up your scene represents , you don\u2019t\nhave the scene yet. So\u2026\nFind the conflict\u2026 or reassess\u2026 or dump it.\nAnd if you do, don\u2019 t cry, it\u2019s only a card.\nREADY T O LET IT FL Y\u2026\nBy the time you\u2019re done, you should have nine cards in row #1, nine in\nrow #2, nine in row #3 and nine in row #4 \u2014 wait! That\u2019 s only 36 cards.\nWell, I\u2019m giving you four extra for those scenes I know you can\u2019t live\nwithout. Stick these wherever you like \u2014 we don\u2019t have to be that precise.\nBut 40 is all that you get\u2026 or need.\nYou do not get points for having the most perfectly laid out Board.\nAnd as much fun as it is to play with these cards, and fantasiz e about the\nebb and flow of your story , there is a point where you must ask yourself,\n\u201cAm I in the Board-building business or am I a screenwriter?\u201d If your\nBoard is too perfect, or if you spend too much time trying to make it so,\nthen you have left the world of preparation and entered the Procrastination\nZone. Well, don\u2019t. In fact, I always like to start writing when I\u2019m coming up\non the end of finishing The Board, just before it gets too perfect. Like a Jell-\nO\u00ae mold that\u2019s not quite set, you wanna start befor e it hardens. By then I\u2019m\nobsessed with pushpins and index cards and I know it\u2019 s time \u2014 to stop.\nTo me, always, speed is the key. I want to figure this all out so I can\nget to the writin g. And once I have my 40 beats laid out and my +/- and ><\ndone on each card, I know I\u2019ve done as much as humanly possible to\nprepare. And now I\u2019m ready to put away my pushpins and cards and pens\u2026\nand start typing. (Suddenly typing will feel GREA T!)\nThe work on The Board is important. But it\u2019s a trick I play on myself,\nan exercise in storing moments, rhythms, scenes, and scene sequences in\nmy brain. It allows me to play with these elements without commitment to\nany of them. I must always be willing to throw it all away as I begin the\nwriting process. How many times have I gotten in there and started writing\nand dumped every preconceived notion of what I had? How many times\nhave I fallen in love with a mino r character that has risen to become one of\nthe leads  who wasn\u2019 t even ment ioned in the outline of my Board? Well, lots\nis the answer . That\u2019s what happens. What The Board will do for you is\nprepare the battlefield, allow you to test your theories, grind  in certain\nnotions, and minimize others.\nFINAL WORDS ON THE SUBJECT\nTruth is when you write FADE IN: The Board means nothing. But I\nhope the things I\u2019ve tried to get across to you will still be burning in your\nbrain and will stick with you. These are: the necessity of hitting your act\nbreak on page 25, hitting the midpoint and All Is Lost hard, and the need to\nhave conflict in every  scene. Even if these things are all that you remember\nas you get lost in your story , you\u2019ll be in great shape. These islands in a sea\nof uncertainty are important to keep in sight as you begin to write.\nAnd it\u2019 s all designed to get you to THE END.\nThe blessing of having this handy guide up on the wall of your work\nroom is: If you do get lost, if you can\u2019t figure out what happen s next, you\ncan always go back to The Board and get back on track. The worst thing\nthat can happen in screenwriting is to not finish . Half-written screenplays\nnever  sell, that\u2019s for sure. And worki ng out The Board in advance is your\nbest guarantee that this won\u2019 t happen.\nCHECKING IN WITH MY SECRET WEAPON\nOf course when I\u2019m really stuck, I call Mike Cheda.\n\u201cMiiiike,\u201d I whine. \u201cI don\u2019t know what happens in Bad Guys Close In,\ncan you take a look?\u201d I then e-mail my notes to Mike and go have an\nexpensive lunch up at The Eurotrash Caf\u00e9 on Sunset Plaza, confident that\nSOMEONE is working on my project \u2014 even if it\u2019s not me. Mike is the\none person I know in Hollywood who actually reads the material you send\nhim and knows how to fix it! He will even give you detailed  notes. And\nhe\u2019s a real smart aleck too \u2014 which I like (it keeps me on my toes). But you\nknow you\u2019re in trouble when you come back from your expen sive lunch,\nhaving flirted with the Euro-Hostess and feeling very good, and you call\nMike and the first thing out of his mouth is: \u201cY ou\u2019re kidding, right?\u201d\nIf you too want to reach Mike Cheda for screenwriting advice, you can\ndo so on the Internet at www .mikecheda.com , where for a fee of $500 Mike\nwill read and analyze your screenplay . I think this is the bargain of the\ncentury and I am always telling  him to up his price. He should be charging\n$5,000 per script if you ask me. A story about Mike in Creative\nScreenwriting  Magazi ne referred to him as \u201cThe Dr. Phil of screenwriting.\u201d\nAnother understatement. To me, he\u2019ll always be the guy who taught me\neverything I know .\nFor free.\nSUMMAR Y\nSo now you know everything about your movie that you need to start\nwriting your screenplay . If you have held off long enough on your movie\nidea to do the steps I have suggested, you\u2019re ready to write FADE IN: and\nbegin.\nAre you excited?\nYou should be. But let\u2019s just make sure you\u2019re set by going over the\n\u201cGet Ready for Y our Deep-Sea Dive\u201d Checklist:\n \n1. You have come up with a great  idea. And I mean it\u2019s killer! You\nhave a killer title, a KILLER logline, and you\u2019ve tested it on friends\nand strangers, and every one of them can\u2019 t wait to see your movie!\n2. You have done your homewor k on genre. You\u2019ve figured out\nwhat your movie is most like and screened every relevant Hollywood\nfilm in the past 20 years. You know what the filmmakers did right,\nwhat they did wrong, and more importantly how your movie will be a\nstep forward and be the same thing\u2026 only different. And you are\nconvinced you\u2019ve got something new!!\n3. You have figure d out the perfec t hero to take this journey . This is\nthe character that offers the most conflict in that situation, has the\nlongest way to go emotionally , and is the most demographically\npleasing! And you\u2019ve given your hero a primal goal and a real bad guy\nwho wants to stop him from achieving it!!!\n4. Finally you have beat out your movie using the BS2 and have put\nup all those great scenes on The Board, tried many ideas, them es, and\nstorylines, and have whittled it all down to 40 actual scenes with each\nscene indicating  its emotional change from beginning to end (+/-) and\nwhat the conflict is in each (><)!!!!\nMan, are you ready!! What\u2019 s stopping you?\nWhile you go off and start writing your screenplay , we\u2019ll be waiting\nfor you and rooting you on. We\u2019ll be the guy up on the dock that feeds the\noxygen tube down to you, the deep-sea diver , as you descend into the\ndepths of your subconscious mind. Make sure that in your life you too have\nsimilar support from friends and loved ones. Because as you drop into the\ndepths of your story , trying to capture the thoughts and the feelings you\nneed to accomplish your missio n, you have to trust that those up in the real\nworld are supporting you and are watching your back. It\u2019s weird down\nthere! You\u2019ll see all manner of wondrous and strange things, be amazed by\nwhat you\u2019re capable of handling , and surprised by how great an experience\nit can be. But it\u2019s also dangerous; doubt and anxiety will plagu e you, and,\nlike the bends, it will cause you to see fearful things that aren\u2019 t even there.\nIn order to get through to THE END you\u2019ve got to have someo ne back on\nland that you trust, that\u2019 s supporting and nurturing your ef fort.\nWhether you have that situation  in your life or not, we\u2019ll  be up on the\ndock waiting for you. And wishing you well. We who write screenplays\nwant to see you win, and win big time, and we know exactly what you\u2019re\ngoing through down there and want you not to worry . So as you descend\ninto the murk, as ready as you\u2019ll ever be, we wish you good hunting. And\nwhile we wait for you to come up, we\u2019ll kill a little time and talk about\nsome fun things in screenwriting.\nGood luck, and Godspeed, Screenwriter .\nEXERCISES\n \n1. Take the beat sheet from one of the movies you have screened\nfrom your genre and write the beats on index cards. Put the cards up on\nThe Board, or if you have not gone to Staples yet, try the portable\nversion.\n2. Find several scenes from your favorite movies and break them\ndown according  to their +/- values. How does the scene start\nemotionally? How does it end emotionally? Are these opposite\nemotional beats?\n3. Now take the same scenes and test them for >< conflict. Who or\nwhat are the opposing forces on each side of the conflict? Who wins?\nDo your favorite scenes in these movies have the most conflict? Is\nbigger conflict better?\nThe real inspirat ion for this book started with one simple desire : I had\na whole bunch of snappy rules for screenwriting and I wanted to get credit\nfor coining them.\nThere! I said it.\nThese are little ironclad laws that my screenwriting buddies and I have\ncollected over the years. And I love \u2019em! It\u2019s because, to me, screenwriting\nis a science as much as an art. It\u2019s quantifiable. The rules that govern it are\nconstants, and in some cases eternal (see Joseph Campbell).\nLike any study of the craft of storytelling, these truths become\napparent as you watch movie  after movie. And when one of these\nimmutable laws is suddenly clear to you, the urge to yell \u201cEureka!\u201d is\noverwhelming. Y ou want to plant your flag on it and claim it as your own.\nOf course it\u2019s not. These laws can\u2019t be \u201cdiscovered.\u201d They\u2019re truths\nthat existed way before you or I came along. Yet every time another one\npops into my lexicon, I am thrilled .\nI love these Imm utable Laws of Screenplay Physics so much I wanted\nto make this whole book about nothing else \u2014 but common sense\nintervened. To get to the good part, I had to explain the screenwriting\nprocess, from idea to execution, in order for anyone to understand what I\nwas talking about.\nAnd aren\u2019 t you glad I did?\nBut even though this is the dessert part for me, the fun, the raison\nd\u2019etr e of the whole operation, there are some of you out there who will still\nwant to pee on my Pop Tarts. Yes, there will be a few among you who will\ndoubt my rules!\nYou are the type of person who bucks the system, who wants to make\nyour own rules, thank you very much. When told that you can\u2019t do\nsomething, you want to do it all the more.\nYou know\u2026 a screenwriter!\nTo those of you who doubt me, bravo! But at least let me show  off a\nlittle bit here, let me run amok \u2014 ego-wise \u2014 and tell you how smart I am\nto have uncovered these things before you go and stomp them dead. And try\nto remem ber the value of know ing these is so that you can override them.\nBefore Picasso could dabble in Cubism, he had to become a master of basic\ndrawing. It gave him credibility and authority . So for you budding Picassos,\na few of my screenwriting basics:\nSAVE THE CA T\nI\u2019ve found that Save the Cat, the title of this book and the\nscreenwriting law it denotes, is amazingly controversial! Though many\nscreenwriters I\u2019ve shown this manuscript to are impressed with its premise,\na few are horrified with this one idea and find it my least best thought.\nMany think my example of Save the Cat found in Sea of Love  (as detailed\nin the Introduction of this book) is old-fashioned and the worst piece of\nadvice in an otherwise helpful primer . Not only that, they find the idea of\nmaking the hero \u201clikeable\u201d to be cloying and dull, an exercise in kissing up\nto the audience.\nTo review , Save the Cat is the screenwriting rule that says: \u201cThe hero\nhas to do something when we meet him so that we like him and want him to\nwin.\u201d Does this mean that every movie we see has to have some scene in it\nwhere the hero gives a buck to a blind man in order to get us onboard? Well\nno, because that\u2019s only part of the definition. So on behalf of my\nhypercritical critics, allow me a mid-course addition:\nThe adjunct to Save the Cat says: \u201cA screenwriter must be mindful of\ngetting the audience \u2018in sync\u2019 with the plight of the hero from the very\nstart.\u201d To explain what I mean,  let\u2019s take a look at a movie that definitely\ndoes not try to kiss up to the audience: Pulp Fiction . Scene One of Pulp\nFiction , basically , is where we meet John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson.\nThese are the \u201cheroes.\u201d They are also drug-addicted hitmen (with really bad\nhaircuts). Quentin Tarantino does a very smart thing when we meet these\ntwo potentially unlikable guys \u2014 he makes them funny . And naive. Their\ndiscussion abou t the names of McDonald\u2019 s hambur gers in France is\nhilarious. And sort of childlike. We like these guys from the jump \u2014 even\nthough they\u2019re about to go kill someone \u2014 we are \u201cwith\u201d them. In a sense,\nTarantino absolutely follows the STC rule. He knows he has a problem:\nThese two guys are about to do something despicable. And in the case of\nTravolta, he will become one of the main characters of the film, a guy the\naudience must  like in order to root for him. Well, after meeting these two\ncrazy knuckleheads, we do like them. They\u2019re funny . Instead of risking the\naudience\u2019 s good  will by making them existential hard asses without a soul,\nscreenwriter T arantino, in his own way , makes them sorta huggable.\nSave the Cat!\nThe problem of making anti-heroes likeable, or heroes of a\ncomeuppance tale likeable enough to root for, can also be finessed with\nSTC. The Immutable Laws of Screenplay Physics tell us that when you\nhave a semi-bad  guy as your hero \u2014 just make his antagonist worse !! A\nlittle further on in the introductory scene of Pulp Fiction , Tarantino does\njust that. Before he and Samuel Jackson reach the door of their victims,\nTravolta raises the specter of their Boss, and tells a story of how an\nunderling, like himself, was thrown out of a window for giving the Boss\u2019 s\nwife a foot massage. This is just another example of a great STC trick:\nWhen your hero is slightly damaged goods, or even potentially unlikable,\nmake his enemy even more horrible. If you think Travolta is bad, well, look\nat the Boss. Travolta is a doll compared to that guy. And BINGO! The\nscales of whom we like versus whom we hate are adjusted to perfect\nbalance. Let the rooting begin!\nThe problem of unlikable heroe s even occurs in nice family films. My\nfavorite Save the Cat example, and one that I repeat way too often, comes\nfrom the Disney movie, Aladdin . When developing this hit film, Disney\nfound they had a real problem with the likeability of the main character . Go\nback and read the source material. Aladdin, as described in the original\nstories, is kind of a jerk. Spoiled. Lazy . And, to make matters worse, a thief!\nThank God, Disney had Terry Rossio and Ted Elliott on their team. Rossio\nand Elliott are to me the two best screenwriters working in Hollywood\ntoday . (And so unsung! Where is their publicist?!?!)\nWhat these two crafty writers did was give Aladdin an introd uction\nthat solved the problem and was a classic example of Save the Cat. In that\n$100+ million hit, the first thing we see Aladdin do is impishly steal food\nbecause, well, he\u2019s hungry . Chas ed by Palace Guards with scimi tars all over\nthe market square (a great way to introduce wher e we are too, btw), Aladdin\nfinally eludes them. Safe in an alley , he is about to chow down on his stolen\npita, when he spots two starving kids. And, what a guy! Aladdin gives his\nfalafel snack to them . Well now we\u2019re \u201cwith\u201d Aladdin. And even though\nhe\u2019s not quite the original thiev ing, layabout character , we\u2019re rooting for\nhim. Because Rossio and Elliott took time to get us in sync with the plight\nof this unlikely hero, we want to see him win.\nThe point of all this is: Care! Though you don\u2019 t have to have a scene in\nevery movie where the hero literally saves a cat, helps an old lady across\nthe street, or gets splashed by water at the street corner to make us love him,\nyou must take the audience by the hand every time out and get them in sync\nwith your main character and your story . You must take time to frame the\nhero\u2019 s situation in a way that makes us root for him, no matter who he is or\nwhat he does. If you don\u2019t, if you go the Lara Cr oft route and assume  we\u2019ll\nlike your main character \u2014 just cuz \u2014 you\u2019re not doing your job. And even\nthough some movies do this and get away with it, it doesn\u2019 t make it okay .\nOr good and careful storytelling.\nAm I of f the hook on this now , fellow screenwriters?\nTHE POPE IN THE POOL\nThe Pope in the Pool is more of a trick than a rule, but it\u2019s a fun one\nthat I love to talk about and one that I see done onscreen all the time. It is\nalso one of the first insights passed on to me by Mike Cheda, script master .\nYour problem is: How to bury the exposition? Exposition  is backstory\nor details of the plot that must  be told to the audience in order for them to\nunderstand what happens next. But who wants to waste time on this? It\u2019s\nboring. It\u2019 s a scene killer . It\u2019s the worst part of any complicated plot.\nSo what\u2019 s a good and caring screenwriter to do?\nMike Cheda told me about a script he once read called The Plot to Kill\nthe Pope , by Geor ge Englund, which did a very smart thing. It\u2019s basically a\nthriller . And the scene where we learn the details of the vital backstory goes\nlike this: Repres entatives visit the Pope at the Vatican. And guess where the\nmeeting takes place? The Vatica n pool. There, the Pope, in his bathing suit,\nswims laps back  and forth while the exposition unfolds. We, the audience,\naren\u2019 t even listening, I\u2019m guessing. We\u2019re thinking: \u201cI didn\u2019 t know the\nVatican had a pool? ! And look, the Pope\u2019 s not wearing his Pope clothes,\nhe\u2019s\u2026 he\u2019s\u2026 in his bathing suit!\u201d And before you can say \u201cWhere\u2019 s my\nmiter?\u201d the scene\u2019 s over .\nThe Pope in the Pool.\nThe Pope in the Pool comes up all the time, but I\u2019ve written one scene\nusing this trick that I\u2019m really proud of. It was in a script called Drips  that\nColby Carr and I wrote and sold to Disney . A comedy (duh!), Drips  is about\ntwo dumb plumbers who are tricked into an oil-stealing plot that is to\nunfold beneath the streets of Beverly Hills. Suckered into the heist by a\nBeautiful Girl, Plumb and Plum ber are invited to the Girl\u2019 s Boss\u2019 s house\nwhere the Bad Guy will explain  the heist and essentially lay out the plot of\nthe movie. He will describe how our two plumbers will be required to tap\ninto an old oil well beneath the house, and connect the runof f to the sewers\nbeneath the city which inevitably lead to the sea and the Bad Guy\u2019 s waiting\noil tanker . (Trust me, it\u2019s possible.) And yet we risked the audience\u2019 s\nattention as we forced them to sit through this potentially joy-killing\nexposition.\nOur solution? The Pope in the Pool.\nIn the scene, before the meeting starts, we show our two doofus  heroes\nhaving an iced- tea drinking contest to show off for the Beautiful Girl \u2014\nwhom they both like. By the time the meeting begins, they both need to pee.\nReally badly . The humor of the scene comes from them sitting there, legs\ncrossed, trying to concentrate on the Bad Guy\u2019 s powerpoint demonstration\nwhile all manner of pee-inducing images are seen around them. Out the\nwindow , lawn sprinklers go on and the neighbor \u2019s dog takes a big, relieving\nwiz on a bush. And in the room , the Girl pours a nice, tall glass of iced tea\nfor herself from  a crystal pitche r. Seeing these things, our two heroes are\ngoing slowly cross-eyed with discomfort, all while the Bad Guy drones on\nwith the vital heist information.\nWe got the information across\u2026 and it\u2019 s hilarious.\nIn the Austin Powers  films, Mike Meyers has done us one better by\nnaming a character Basil Exposition (Michael York), whose sole purpose is\nto tell the boring backstory to the British super spy\u2026 and us. Every time\nBasil appears we know we\u2019re going to get a dose of elucidation,  but revel in\nthe fact that they know we know it\u2019 s boring and have made light of that fact.\nThere are dozens of examples of the Pope in the Pool and now that you\nare aware of it (if you weren\u2019 t already), you can come up with new ways to\nbury the backstory . Whether it\u2019s the two funny guards scene in Pirates of\nthe Caribbean , where we get the lowdown on Jack Sparrow , or the batting\ncage scene in a thriller like A Clear and Present Danger , the Pope in the\nPool gives us something to look at that takes the sting out of telling us what\nwe need to know .\nAnd does so in a lively and entertaining way .\nGood trick. Thanks, Mike Cheda.\nDOUBLE MUMBO JUMBO\nDouble Mumbo  Jumbo is a favorite. It is also a rule you and I can\u2019t\nbreak, even though we see it broken all the time!\nI propose to you that, for some reason, audiences will only accept one\npiece of magic per movie . It\u2019s The Law. You cannot see aliens from outer\nspace land in a UFO and then be bitten by a Vampire and now be both\naliens and undead.\nThat, my friends, is Double Mumbo Jumbo.\nYet despite the fact that it throws a big ol\u2019 sabot  into the machinery of\nthe audience\u2019 s brain, even though Double Mumbo Jumbo is logically\nwrong, it\u2019 s done all the time.\nMy favorite example is Spider -Man . Why is it that you went willingly\nto see this movie, it became a big hit, and yet when it comes on cable you\ndon\u2019t want to see it again?\nCan\u2019 t be the actors; we love Tobey and Kirsten and Willem. Can\u2019 t be\nthe special effects; swinging through the city on a spider web is cool! I\npropose that our interest vanishe s around the middle of the movie when the\nGreen Goblin first appears. That\u2019 s where I always lose interest anyway .\nWhy? Double Mumbo Jumbo.\nThe makers of Spider -Man  ask us to belie ve two pieces of magic in\none movie. Over here on this side of town, a kid is bitten by a radioactive\nspider and endowed with superh ero powers that combine nuclear fusion and\narachnia. Okay . I\u2019ll buy that. But then over on the other side of town,\nWillem DaFoe is getting a whole  other set of magic powers from an entirely\ndifferent source when a lab accid ent transmutes him into The Green Goblin.\nSo\u2026 you\u2019re saying that we have a radioactive spider bite AND  a chemical\naccident?! And both give one super powers? I\u2019m confused! They\u2019re\nstraining my suspension of disbelief. They\u2019re breaking the reality of the\nworld they asked me to believe in once already . How dare they! Like Save\nthe Cat, when I see the DMJ rule violated I get mad. It\u2019s sloppy . It\u2019s a\nproduct of moronic creativity . Yet in the world of comic books, you\u2019re sort\nof excused.\nDouble Mumbo  Jumbo is also in another big hit, one that doesn\u2019t get\nlet off the hook because it\u2019s from a comic book. In M. Night Shyamalan\u2019 s\nSigns , we are asked to believe that aliens from outer space have invaded\nEarth. Apart from the really embarrassing finale in which a super intelligent\nalien is dispatch ed with a baseb all bat (\u201cSwing away , Merrill!\u201d is now my\nfavorite bad line), the movie is about  Mel Gibson\u2019 s crisis of faith in God.\n\u201cSwing away , Merrill!\u201d A super -intelligent alien who has traveled light\nyears in a highly advanced spacecraft is dispatched with a Louisville\nSlugger in M. Night Shymaylan\u2019 s Signs .\nHuh?!\nI\u2019d say proof of an alien intell igence outside our solar system sorta\ntrumps all discussion about faith in God, don\u2019t you think? But M. asks us to\njuggle both. And it\u2019 s a mess.\nMy guess is M. started his script with his one piece of magic \u2014 aliens,\ncrop circles \u2014 and realized we\u2019d seen that. In an effort to make his alien\nmovie different, he tried to make it meaningful. Okay . But in doing so, he\nalso made it muddy . The minute aliens arrive, the problem of Mel Gibson\u2019 s\ncrisis of faith is, well, ridiculou s. You want to see a miracle? Look out the\nwindow \u2014 ALIENS HAVE LANDED, MEL!!!! Because what M. is asking\nus to balance in our minds is a debate about whether or not God AND Little\nGreen Men exist.\nWell, God and aliens don\u2019t mix. Why? Because it\u2019s two sets of\ndifferent kinds of magic. It\u2019s Double Mumbo Jumbo. And if you don\u2019t\nbelieve me, try substituting the word \u201cAllah\u201d for the word \u201cGod\u201d and see if\nyour brain doesn\u2019 t melt.\nSo unles s you too have a hit movie in your back pocket, or a comic\nbook you must translate to screen, don\u2019 t try it.\nOnly one piece of magic per movie, please.\nIt\u2019s The Law .\nLAYING PIPE\nMinority Report  starring Tom Cruise did it. So did Along Came Polly\nfeaturing Ben Stiller and Jennifer Anniston. Each of these movies did\nsomething that risked failure. And once I point out their flaw, you will see\nthat perhaps they did more than risk it. In my opinion, both these movies\ncame up short because the filmmakers went long. They forgot one of the\nimmutable laws of movie physics we screenwriters live by:\nAudiences can only stand so much \u201cpipe.\u201d\nWhat is pipe? And what is the risk of laying too much of it?\nWell, let\u2019s take a look at Minority Report , the big-budget movie based\non yet another work by sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick. In death , Dick has\nbecome the \u201cgo-to guy\u201d for source material that has resulted in such hits as\nBlade Runner  and Total Recall . In Minority Report  the hook is typically\nDickian, but in this case, setting up the premise almost kills the story .\nMinority Report  is about future crime. And we see exactly how this works\nin the opening scene of the film. A homicide is about to take place, and\nsince Tom Cruis e is in charge of the task force that monitors these future\ncrimes, we see him spring into action and stop the murder . In the next\nscene, we jump to the politics involved in how this operation works. Tom,\nwe learn, is under investigation by Colin Farrell. We even meet the three\n\u201cpre-cognitives\u201d who lie in a tub of water and predict the future. We also\nsee that in his personal life, Tom lost his child and has some kind of drug\nproblem. We also meet Tom\u2019s mentor (Max Von Sydow) whom we don\u2019t\ntotally trust. Okay . All well and good. But by the time the writers lay out\nthe pipe required to set up this story , I am personally exhausted! It\u2019s\ninteresting, but what\u2019 s the point? Where is this going?\nThe story finally gets under way when Tom receives the latest future\nnews and lo! the criminal pegged is himself. Knowing that the pre-cogs are\nnever wrong, Tom must find out how and why this mistake has been made\n\u2014 and stop the murder that he supposedly will commit. The clock is\nrunning; and so are we. There\u2019 s only one small problem: By the time this\nplot point happe ns, we are 40 MINUTES INTO THE MOVIE! It took 40\nminutes  to set up this story and explain to the audience what it\u2019s about. It\ntook 40 minutes  to get to the hook, which is: A detective discovers he is the\ncriminal.\nSay it with me now , fellow students: That\u2019 s a lot of pipe!!\nIn Along Came Polly , we find the same problem. In order to get to\nrisk-averse divorcee Ben Stiller falling in love with crazy girl Jennifer\nAnniston, the writer also has a lot of pipe to lay. We have to see Ben marry\nhis first wife, follow them on their honeymoon, and watch as Ben catches\nher in the arms of their scuba instructor . Sure it\u2019s funny . And we\u2019ll put up\nwith a lot when it comes to any movie that Ben is in. We love Mr. S! But\nthe screenwriter  and director (same guy \u2014 the funny and talented John\nHambur g) risks our attention by laying a ton of story points to get to the\nreason we came to see this movie: Ben Stiller dating Jennifer Anniston.\nIn both Along Came Polly  and Minority Report , the laying of all that\npipe \u2014 a neces sary thing to set up the story \u2014 risks our attention and, I\nbelieve, contributes to a lesser movie-going experience. By needing so\nmuch backstory to set up the movie, the whole story has been torqued out of\nshape.\nTo be honest, laying pipe is something about which I am hyper -aware,\nand in many cases I have stopped writing stories due to the pipe required to\nset them up. Blank Check  has a little bit more pipe up front that I am\ncomfortable with. There is way too much \u2018splainin\u2019 to do to get us to the\npoint where our hero, Preston, walks into the bank with his blank check for\na million bucks. A lot of back and forth. A lot of pipe. It\u2019s not quite fatal,\nbut almost. There\u2019 s about a half a beat more movie in Act One than I like.\nAnd it risks the audience\u2019 s patience. Get to it!! I hear them screaming. And\nas screenwriters , we need to be aware of risking the attention spans of our\naudience. The point is if you find yourself with a set-up that takes more\nthan 25 pages to introduce, you\u2019ve got problems. We call it \u201claying pipe;\u201d\nthe audience calls it \u201cI want my money back!\u201d\nBLACK VET A.K.A. T OO MUCH MARZIP AN\nWhen dealing with conceptual creativity , an offshoot of the Double\nMumbo Jumbo rule is a rule I call Black V et.\nYou often fall in love with certa in elements of a movie idea and cling\nto them. You can\u2019t let go. You\u2019re Lenny in Of Mice  and Men and you\u2019re\ngoing to squeez e that little rodent to death. And usually when you find\nyourself in this situation, you must stop. This is when the Black Vet rule\nallows you to step back from the concept.\nWhat is Black V et?\nBetter to tell you where it came from. In the 1970s, comedian and now\nactor/writer/director , Albert Brooks, made several film parodies for\nSatur day Night Live. In one of his best, a piece that tweaked the nose of\nNBC and the silliness of network programming, Brooks did a hilarious fake\npromo for several upcoming shows that would be seen that fall on NBC.\nOne of these was called Black Vet. In unctuous \u201cNBC \u2014 Be There!\u201d\nstyle, it showed  a black actor who played a veterinarian cavorting with\nanimals at his clinic. But this guy also has a past in the military . The\npunchline came when the narrat or announced the name of the show and its\nfake promo line: \u201cBlack Vet: He\u2019s a veteran  and a veterinarian! \u201d Hilarious!\nBut it is also so close to a real show on real TV, so much about the\ndesperation of Hollywood types trying to squeeze 10 pounds of shit into a\nfive-pound bag, that I found it to be brilliant. And I personally never forgot\nit.\u201dBlack Vet\u201d is a joke, and yet you\u2019d be surprised how often we creative\nfolks get caught piling on our great concepts. Like eating too much\nmarzipan, a little goes a long way where ideas are concerned. And more\ndoes not always mean better .\nIn my career , my favorite example of this came when I was working\nwith my first writing partner , the quick-witted and entrepreneurial Howard\nBurkons. We were young and energetic writers with a lot of great ideas \u2014\nand a lot of bad ones. But Howard and I achieved early success and even\nearned our WGA cards while working together , a huge step forward for us\nboth. Because we were working in TV, we had a TV series idea, and a good\none I thought. Set in the 1950s,  it followed the adventures of a blacklisted\nprivate eye. We called the show Lefty . Get it? Lefty referred to his political\naffiliation, but sounded tough and very \u201950s. Okay . But Howard  and I killed\nthe idea when Howard insisted we also make our hero left-handed. And\nmaybe, Howard  suggested, he could also be an ex-boxer , a left-handed ex-\nboxer! So he\u2019s a Communist and an ex-boxer and he\u2019s left-handed? I kept\nasking. And Howard thought that was great. Well\u2026 to my mind it was\n\u201cpick one.\u201d To Howard it was a matter of milking the idea for all it was\nworth. And while I usually trusted Howard\u2019 s instinct on this stuff \u2014\nHoward is brilliant when it comes to conceptualizing and a much smarter\nmarketer than I \u2014 I just didn\u2019 t get it.\nIt was T oo Much Marzipan.\nIt was Black V et.\nWhat we had succumbed to was getting stuck on a good idea. And it\u2019s\neasy to do. You like that? Well, hell you\u2019ll like it even more if I just add a\ncouple of more scoops of the same thing on top, right? W ell, no. T o this day ,\nwhenever I talk with my pal Howard, he insists he was right about Lefty .\nMe? It\u2019s a whistle I don\u2019t hear. Still! But it makes a great rule of\nscreenwriting and creativity: Simple is better . One concept at a time, please.\nYou cannot digest too much information or pile on more to make it better . If\nyou do, you get confused. If you do\u2026 stop.\nWATCH OUT FOR THA T GLACIER!\nVery often when bad guys are involved, they will be way off screen\nsomewhere, far away from our hero, and \u201cclosing in.\u201d Sometimes they\nclose in so slowly , the noose tightens so lackadaisically , you want to yell at\nthe screen:\nWatch Out for That Glacier!\nWell, I do anyway .\nThat\u2019 s how the \u201cdanger\u201d is coming toward your hero: s-l-o-w-l-y! One\ninch per year. That\u2019 s how unthreatening your supposedly threatening horror\nis. And if you think this doesn\u2019 t happen to the big boys as well as you and\nme, you\u2019re wrong. Slow danger happens to good movies all the time.\nJust check out Pierce Brosnan in Dante\u2019 s Peak , one of two volcano\nmovies that came out in 1997, presumably to cash in on all that Mt. St.\nHelen\u2019 s buzz. And here\u2019 s what Dante\u2019 s Peak  is about: See that volcano? It\u2019s\ngonna blow any minute!! That\u2019 s it! And that\u2019s all it is. A volcano is about to\nerupt and no one believes the handsome scientist (Pierce Brosnan), so we sit\nthere and wait for him to be right (we saw the trailer). Well, while we\u2019re\nwaiting at least we can look at Brosnan and think: Yeah, Sean Connery was\nbetter .\nAnd check out Dustin Hoffman in Outbr eak. Now there\u2019 s a dull\nmovie! Basically , it\u2019s about a super Ebola virus that comes to the U.S. and\nHoffman\u2019 s attem pt to find the cure. But while we\u2019re waiting, that virus is\nslowly , slowly , really  slowly headed our way. It\u2019s a Monster in the House\nmovie basically , but in Outbr eak, they have to create the \u201chouse\u201d by\nquarantining a small town and introducing us, in thumbnail sketches, to the\npeople who live there so we\u2019ll care if they die. Of course, we don\u2019t meet\nthem until like page 75!! But so what?! We gotta do something  while we\u2019re\nwaiting for this Butterball to baste and for Dustin to catch an infected\nmonkey , which,  if I remember correctly , is the D or E plot of Outbr eak\nand\u2026 Man! How did these guys get talked into this?\nIt even happens in Westerns. In Open Range , Kevin Costner \u2019s and\nRobert Duvall\u2019 s cowboy buddy gets killed by the bad guys on about page\n20, at which point Kevin and Robert sit there on their horses and talk about\nthe bad guys and how they\u2019re gonna go get \u2019em, yup they sure should go\nget \u2019em\u2026 for about an hour and a half!  If you ever wondered how the W est\nwas won, apparently it happened very slowly .\nSee, even bright people think the slow encroaching danger of hot lava\nheaded your way, oh about by Thursday or so, will get our emotions\nstirring. But lo! it does not.\nDanger must be present  danger . Stakes must be stakes for people we\ncare about. And what might happen to them must be shown from  the get-go\nso we know the consequences  of the imminent threat. If not, you are\nviolating the Watch Out for That Glacier rule. Here is a list of other\n\u201cglaciers\u201d that approach slowly or are too remote, unthreatening, or dull:\n \n> An evil Slinky\n> Snails armed with AK-47s\n> A foreclosure letter sent from Siberia\n> A homicidal one-legged Grandmother\n> A herd of angry turtles\n> Locusts\nEven if you have a catchy title, do not write movies with these \u201cbad\nguys.\u201d Okay , well, unless the locusts are biologically-altered locusts that\nlike to eat human flesh!!\nThen we\u2019ll talk.\nTHE COVENANT OF THE ARC\nThe Covenant of the Arc is the screenwriting law that says: Every\nsingle character in your movie must change in the course of your story . The\nonly characters who don\u2019t change are the bad guys. But the hero and his\nfriends change a lot.\nAnd it\u2019 s true.\nAlthough I hate the term \u201carc\u201d because it\u2019s gotten so overu sed by\ndevelopment executives and How to Write a Screenplay authors, I do like\nwhat it stands for. Arc is a term that means \u201cthe chang e that occurs to any\ncharacter from the beginning, through the middle, and to the end of each\ncharacter \u2019s \u2018jour ney\u2019\u201d (another est-y kind of term). But when it\u2019s done well,\nwhen we can chart the growth and change each character under goes in the\ncourse of a movie, it\u2019s a poem. What you are saying in essence is: This\nstory , this experience, is so important, so life-changing for all involved \u2014\neven you, the audience \u2014 it affects every single person that is in its orbit.\nFrom time immemorial, all good stories show growth and track change in\nall its characters.\nWhy is this?\nI think the reaso n that characters must change in the course of a movie\nis because if your story is worth telling, it must be vitally important to\neveryone involv ed. This is why set-ups and payof fs for each character have\nto be crafted carefully and tracked throughout. I don\u2019t know why, but Pretty\nWoman  comes to mind as a good example of this. Everybody arcs in Pretty\nWoman . Richar d Gere, Julia Roberts, Laura San Giacomo \u2014 even the\nmentor figure, Hector Elizondo  \u2014 are touched by the experience of this\nlove story and transformed because of it. Everyone but the bad guy, Jason\nAlexander , who learns exactly zero.\nPretty Woman  is one of hundreds of carefully crafted, successful\nmovies in which this rule applies. All the really good movies do this, ones\nthat you rememb er, that make you laugh and cry \u2014 the ones that you want\nto see a second time.\nHint, hint.\nIn a sense, storie s are about  change. And the measuring stick that tells\nus who succeed s and who doesn\u2019 t is seen in the ability to change. Good\nguys are those who willingly accept change and see it as a positive force.\nBad guys are those who refuse to change, who will curl up and die in their\nown juices, unable to move out of the rut their lives represent. T o succeed in\nlife is to be able to transform. That\u2019 s why it\u2019s the basis not only of good\nstorytelling but also the world\u2019 s best-known religions. Change is good\nbecause it represents re-birth, the promise of a fresh start.\nThe Covenant of the Arc.\nAnd don\u2019 t we all want to believe that?\nDon\u2019 t we all want to jump into the swim of life after seeing a good\nmovie? Don\u2019 t we want to get out of our ruts, try something new, and be\nopen to the healing power of change after experiencing a movie in which\neverybody arcs?\nYes, we do.\n\u201cEverybody arcs.\u201d That\u2019 s one of the slogans I have written on a yellow\nPost-it\u00ae note and have stuck to the top of my iMac computer whenever I am\nwriting a screenplay . And before I sit down to write, I make notes on how\nall my characters are going to arc by charting their stories as they are laid\nout on The Board, with the milestones of change noted as each character\nprogresses through the story .\nIt is a must that you do the same.\nIf your script feels flat, if you are getting the sense that something\u2019 s\nnot happening in the story , do a quick Covenant of the Arc check and see if\nyou need to do more work on making everybody change and grow and\ntransform.\nEveryone, that is, except the bad guy .\nKEEP THE PRESS OUT!\nHere\u2019 s where I get to show off. Big time! You see, I learned this next\nlesson from Steven Spielber g. Personally . Oh yeah\u2026 We worked together .\nAnd it was one of the most educational experiences of my career. But in\nterms of the Immutable Laws of Screenwriting, that\u2019s the guy who really\nshould write the book. I can only paraphrase.\nTo wit:\nKeep the Press Out, the rule I learned from Steven Spielber g, was\ntaught to me while we were developing a screenplay Jim Haggin and I had\nsold to Amblin called Nuclear Family . The premise of this movie is: A\nfamily camps out one night on a nuclear dumpsite and wakes up the next\nday with super powers. Nuclear Family  is a wish-fulfillment comedy . Each\nfamily member has a need that their super -power quenches: Dad, an ad\nexec, gets the power to read minds and thus leaps ahead of his ratfink\nnemesis at work; Mom, a housewife, gets the power of telekinesis and\nbecomes a super Mom who can move objects with her mind; Teen Son\nbecomes The Flash and is suddenly his high school\u2019 s star halfback; and\nTeen Daughter , forever behind in her schoolwork, gets a super brain and is\nnow able to ace her SATs. It\u2019s a fun, special effects-laden fantasy \u2014 but it\nhas a message, too. In the end, each of them gives up their powers. Being\n\u201csuccessful\u201d they find is not as important as being a family .\nAnd yet, in the development process, we wanted to explore every\noption. When one of us, me I think, foolishly pitched that mayb e we should\nhave these powers discovered  by the media, and to have the family\nswarmed by the news networks, Steven Spielber g said no, and he told us\nwhy.\nYou\u2019ll notice that there are no news crews in E.T., the story of an extra-\nterrestrial creature who comes to Earth and into the lives of a similar cul de\nsac-dwelling family. Sure, you\u2019ve got a really good reason for a news crew .\nThey\u2019ve caught one \u2014 a real live alien! And it\u2019s right there for everyone to\nsee. But in rewrites with the screenwriter , Melissa Mathison, Spielber g\ndiscovered that it blew the reality of the premise to invite the press in. By\nkeeping it contained among the family and on the block, by essentially\nkeeping this secret between them and us, the audience, the magic stayed\nreal. When you think about it, to bring the press into E.T. would indeed\nhave ruined it. The term breaking the fourth wall springs to mind . That is\nthe phrase that means violating the gossamer beneath the proscenium arch\nthat separates the play from the audience. To bring the press into our little\ndrama would have done the same.\nOf course this is what separates  the Spielber gs from the rest of us \u2014\nincluding the Shyamalans. Keep the Press Out is a rule you won\u2019 t see\nviolated in any DreamW orks film, but in M. Night Shyamalan\u2019 s Signs\n(there\u2019 s that darn movie again) the rule is violated and, I think, suffers\nbecause of it.\nHoled up in their Pennsylvani a farmhouse, Mel Gibson\u2019 s family is\nbesieged by aliens. First the crop circles, then aliens arrive and try to break\ninto Mel\u2019s house (and do what? We\u2019re not sure) Night Of the Living Dead -\nlike. So while we\u2019re waiting for the attack, Mel and his family put on their\ntin-foil hats (Gad! What a movie!) and watch TV. There on CNN, news of\nother aliens landing all over the world is reported. There\u2019 s even some\nspooky footage of one such alien invading a children\u2019 s birthday party in\nSouth America.\nAnd all that\u2019s interesting, but so what? What does it have to do with\nthe drama of Mel trying to protect his family from the aliens that are\nswarming his house? I think it even makes their situation less desperate:\nThey\u2019re no longer alone with this problem, everyone\u2019 s dealing with it. Like\nin the E.T. example, bringing the press into \u201cour secret\u201d wrecks it. And it\ntook me, as an audience member , out of the story .\nThe point is, bring the press in with care. Unless it\u2019s about the press,\nunless your movie involves a worldwide problem and we follow stories\nwith characters all over the world, and it\u2019s important for them all to know\nabout each other , take a tip from me\u2026 and Steven Spielber g:\nKeep the Press Out.\nSUMMAR Y\nSo now you know some basics and if you\u2019re like me, you want to\nknow more and make up others as you go on. These are little Eurekas! that\none experiences  after watching a truckload of movies over the years.\nSuddenly you realize why things are done, what that scene really  was for,\nand it makes you feel like a genius. Suddenly you\u2019re in on the tricks of\nscreenwriting and have the experience of actually opening up the back of\nthe Swiss watch, and seeing how the gears are put together . So THA T\u2019S\nhow that works! you suddenly think.\nYou feel like you\u2019re learning the magician\u2019 s secrets.\nOnce you see these little tricks, the urge to put a label to them can\u2019t be\nfar behind. This is why Save the Cat, the Pope in the Pool, Black Vet, and\nKeep the Press Out are memora ble \u2014 to me anyway \u2014 and vital to be so.\nYes, it\u2019s good, slangy fun. It\u2019s also a way not to forget what you\u2019ve learned.\nAnd when you catch yourself drifting into a mistake, or pushing up against\na rule you\u2019d like to break, these pithy little lessons give you an instant\nassessment on the pros and cons of minding or breaking\u2026 The Law. How\nmany times have I caught myself drifting into one or more of these errors\nduring the cours e of creating and writing a screenplay? Well, many. But the\npoint of all this is to learn shortcuts to save time.\nScreenwriting is like solving a puzzle over and over. You get faster\nwith practice. The more stories you break, the more outlines you beat out to\ntheir completion , the more screenplays you tag with THE END, the better\nyou get. These shortcuts are essential time-savers.\nEXERCISES\n \n1. Name a movie hero that is unlikable. Did the creators of the\nmovie do anythi ng to deal with this? What new Save the Cat tricks can\nbe used to make a hero likable, but not so phony-baloney that we reject\nthe device?\n2. Find examples in other movies that use the Pope in the Pool. Does\nburying the exposition hurt or enhance your understanding of what\u2019 s\ngoing on in the plot?\n3. Fix Spider -Man . Let\u2019s say you don\u2019t have to follow the storyline\nthat was created in the Marvel  comic book Stan Lee created . What\nchanges would you make to the screenplay that could eliminate its\nDouble Mumbo Jumbo?\n4. Since you liked M. Night Shyamalan\u2019 s Signs  and think that I am\nout of my mind for not liking it, e-mail me at the address found at the\nend of Chapter One and explain M. Night Shyamalan\u2019 s Unbr eakable  to\nme \u2014 a movie so preposterous it makes Signs  look like Battleship\nPotemkin . But remember , I\u2019ve been working on my argument and am\nstill ticked about not getting my $10 back from the theater!\nYou\u2019ve made it!\nCongratulations!\nYou\u2019ve followed  my advice, you\u2019ve done the prep, you\u2019ve hit your\nmarks like a pro, and you\u2019ve finally written THE END.\nAnd whether you\u2019ve got 90 pages or 130, you\u2019ve accomplished what\nyou set out to do: Y ou\u2019ve written a draft of a movie.\nYou are amazing!\nSo before going on any further , let\u2019s bask for a moment in the glory of\nyour success.\nFinishing a screenplay separate s you from five out of 10 would-be\nscreenwriters who only talk about writing their movie ideas. You have\nincreased your odds of success immeasurably by doing the work. And\nwhether it\u2019s your first script or your twenty-first, you have one more notch\non your belt in a never -ending shootout with your creative demons. You\u2019ve\nnot only written a screenplay , you\u2019ve gotten better at the job, and each one\nyou write makes you better still.\nMe? I\u2019ve writte n or co-written 75 screenplays, including TV scripts,\nand when I compare the ones I wrote initially to the ones I\u2019m writing now, I\ncan see real growth in my skills. I can always get better at this. And as long\nas I maintain the attitude that the next script will be my best yet, and keep\nbeing excited about the process, I know I can\u2019 t fail.\nBut back  to you. You\u2019ve finished! And yet even though you\u2019re a proud\nparent, you\u2019re starting to have a few nagging doubts about this creation of\nyours. Some parts of your script don\u2019t work, you know that. And some\nparts, you think secretly , might be a train wreck. But having put your script\naside for about a week, which I recommend (longer if you can stand it), you\nnow come back to that glorious hatchling, read it over from start to finish\u2026\nand are suddenly struck dumb.\nIt\u2019s awful!!!\nCharacters are flat! Nothing happens or happens so slowly you can\u2019t\nbelieve a human being wrote it and not some mental patient. What were you\nthinking? You\u2019re not done ! You haven\u2019 t even started! What\u2019s worse, now\nthat you know the awful truth, now that you realize how bad you are at this,\nyou don\u2019t even want to keep going. You\u2019ve gone from the high of\nmountaintop megalomania to the depths of self-loathing.\nAm I getting the basic roller -coaster ride?\nWell, fear not. It always happen s. You\u2019ve got a ways to go. But before\nyou jump off the Hollywood sign, take a breath. There\u2019 s a way to prop up\nthis puppy again and get you back on your megalomaniac way .\nI can help you pinpoint and fix some of your rough spots.\nAnd it\u2019 s really not all that hard.\nIt\u2019s just a matter  of being honest in your assessment and willing to do\nthe work to fix all the problems. So, here are typical trouble spots that\nothers have faced, long before  you came along, that may help in your\nrewrite.\nTHE HERO LEADS\nA common mistake in a lot of rough drafts is the problem of the\ninactive hero. It\u2019s often hard to spot, especially if you\u2019ve done everything\nelse right. You\u2019ve gone out of your way to thoroughly plot your screenplay;\nevery beat moves the story forward. But somehow you forgot to inform\nyour lead.\nYour hero is being dragged  through the story , showing up when he\u2019s\nsupposed to but for no reason . Your hero seems unmotivated, his goal\nvague, the driving force that should be guiding him is MIA. Imagine what it\nwould be like if a detective in a murder mystery acted this way. We\u2019ll call\nhim Johnny Entropy because he\u2019s an existential layabout who has no\nmotivation and can\u2019t be paid to care. Johnny shows up, he goes through the\nmotions of the case but he doesn\u2019 t want to. He never seeks clues, they\u2019re\njust given to him. He has no goals. He exists but he doesn\u2019 t know why.\nJohnny\u2019 s motto is: \u201cWhat\u2019 s the point? We\u2019re all gonna die some day\nanyway .\u201d\nDoes this describe your hero?\nWell if so, you\u2019ve got to fix it, because if there\u2019 s one thing we know\nfor sure it\u2019s the truism that: The hero must be proactive . It\u2019s The Law. If\nhe\u2019s not, he\u2019 s not a hero.\nHere\u2019 s a checklist to see if your lead needs more oomph:\n \n1. Is your hero\u2019s goal clearly stated in the set-up?  Is what your\nhero wants obvious to you and to the audience? If not, or if you don\u2019t\nknow what your hero\u2019 s goal is, figure it out. And make sure that goal is\nspoken aloud and restated in action and words throughout the story .\n2. Do clues of what to do next just come to your hero or does he\nseek them out?  If it all happens  too easily for your hero, something\u2019 s\nwrong. Your hero cannot be handed his destiny , he must work for it at\nevery step.\n3. Is your hero active or passive?  If the latter , you have a problem .\nEverything your hero does has to spring from his burning desire and\nhis deep ly held need to achieve his goal. If he can\u2019t be bothered,  or can\nget to that burning desire ma\u00f1ana, you\u2019ve got Hamlet  \u2014 fine if you\u2019re\nShakespeare, bad if you\u2019re writing for V in Diesel.\n4. Do other characters tell your hero what to do or does he tell\nthem?  Here\u2019 s a great rule of thumb: A hero never asks questions! The\nhero knows and others around him look to him for answers, not the\nother way around. If you see a lot of question marks in your hero\u2019 s\ndialogue, there\u2019 s a problem. The hero knows; he never asks.\nMy guess is that if any of the above rings true, you have an inactive\nhero on your hands. And scripts with inactive heroes lay there like a lox. So\nfix it! Give your hero a little kick in the butt and tell him to get in the game.\nCome on, let\u2019 s see some leadership! That\u2019 s what heroes do.\nTALKING THE PLOT\nAnother problem  found in poorly executed screenplays is \u201ctalking the\nplot,\u201d and it\u2019s a dead giveaway that the writer is green. Characters will walk\ninto scenes and say, \u201cWell, you\u2019re my sister , you should know!\u201d and \u201cThis\nsure isn\u2019t like the time I was the star fullback for the N.Y. Giants  until my\u2026\naccident.\u201d This kind of dialogue is\u2026 (say it with me) bad! And yet I\ncompletely understand why it\u2019 s in there.\nYou have backstory and plot to explain, and there\u2019 s no way to say it, so\nyou resort to having your characters say it for you. And it sucks. It\u2019s one of\nthose Guaranteed-to-Have-Y our-Script-Thrown-Across-the-Room-by-the-\nReader things.\nThe reason it makes the hair on the back of our necks stand up is that\nit\u2019s unreal. Who talks like that? You\u2019ve forgotten that your characters don\u2019t\nserve you, they serve themselves. They should walk into each scene with\ntheir own goals and say what\u2019 s on their minds, not yours. You must reveal\nwho they are and what they want, their hopes, dreams, and fears, by how\nthey say it as much as what  they say. Good dialogue tells us more about\nwhat\u2019 s going on in its subtext  than on its surface. Subtle is better . And\ntalking the plot is like using a sledgehammer . It\u2019s overkill.\nAn adjunct to this rule of bad dialogue is \u201cShow , Don\u2019 t Tell,\u201d another\nof the most frequent mistakes found in newbie screenplays. You can say\nmore about a relationship in trouble by seeing a husband eye a pretty young\nthing as he and his wife are walking down the street than by three pages of\ndialogue about how their marriage counseling sessions are going. Movies\nare stories told in pictures. So why would you resort to telling us when you\ncan show us? It\u2019s so much more economical! You want to make sure the\naudience knows  about a guy\u2019s N.Y. Giants past? Show team pictures on the\nwall of his apartment, give him a limp (from the accident that ended his\ncareer , but only if it\u2019s germane) , sneak it in with subtle references. Want to\nmake sure we know a fight has occurred between two people? Have them\ntalk about anyth ing but the fight. If handled right, the audience will get it.\nThey\u2019re a lot more perceptive than you think.\nBy showing and not telling, you leave room for your characters to be\nat their best \u2014 that\u2019s being active, with their own separate agendas for\nbeing there, not yours.\nThe truth is that movies are so much about what happens that we must\nlearn about characters by what they do, not by what they say. As in Life,\ncharacter is revealed by action taken, not by words spoken. And in a good\nmovie, information doesn\u2019 t come out in dialogue, it comes out in the verve\nand forward motion of the story . You must get out all your wonderful plot\nand backstory on the fly, or better yet, not at all. You should be more\nconcerned with what\u2019 s happenin g now than what happened before the story\nstarted. So when you feel yourself drifting into talking the plot, don\u2019t. And\nwhen you think you\u2019re talking too much: Show , don\u2019 t tell.\nMAKE THE BAD GUY BADDER\nAn addition to the idea that The Hero Leads is the rule that says: The\nbad guy must be as bad as possible. Many times, your hero will do\neverything he\u2019s supposed to. He\u2019ll be proactive; he\u2019ll seek out and\novercome obstacles; he\u2019ll do amazing things \u2014 and still we\u2019re\nunimpressed. He\u2019s such a nobody! He\u2019s so average, so unheroic, so\ninsignificant! We don\u2019t want to see nobodies onscreen, we want to see\nheroes.\nIf this seems familiar, then maybe it\u2019s not the hero but his antagonist\nthat\u2019s the proble m, and there\u2019 s an easy solution. Maybe you need to make\nthe bad guy\u2026 badder!\nThis is a common first-draft problem. I think it\u2019s because we want our\nhero to win so badly that we don\u2019t want to make it impossible for him to do\nso. But we cannot protect our hero from danger and challenge; we must\nthrow a little more at him than he is able to take. And making the bad guy\nbadder automati cally makes the hero bigger . It\u2019s one of those  Immutable\nLaws of Screenwriting.\nThink about James Bond. What  makes James Bond a super spy isn\u2019t\nthe gadgets or the girls or the car. What makes him James Bond is\nGoldfinger , Blofeld, and Dr. No. How dull would 007 be if his enemy was\nan evil account ant who was juggling the books down at the local bank.\nWhere would the challenge be in that? Suddenly the gadgets and the car and\nthe charm aren\u2019 t necessary . James can just do a quick skip-trace on the\nInternet and be done in time for Martini Hour . He needs someo ne bigger to\nplay with to make his own heroism bigger . He needs an antag onist whose\npowers match his own.\nIn many a well-told movie, the hero and the bad guy are very often two\nhalves of the same person struggling for supremacy , and for that reason are\nalmost equal in power and ability . How many movies can you name that\nhave a hero and a bad guy who are two halves of the same persona? Think\nabout Batman  (Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson), Die Hard (Bruce\nWillis and Alan Rickman), and even Pretty Woman  (Richard Gere and\nJason Alexander). Aren\u2019 t the hero and the bad guy of each of these movies\nthe light and dark sides of the same person? Aren\u2019 t they the positive and\nnegative x-ray of one soul? And each has something the other wants \u2014\neven if it\u2019 s just an answer to what makes them the way they are.\nThe point is that the hero and the bad guy are a matched set and should\nbe of equal skill and strength, with the bad guy being just slightly more\npowerful than the hero because  he is willing to go to any lengths to win.\nAfter all, the bad guy has given up on having \u201cfamily values\u201d by definition.\nThis does not mean you make the bad guy impossible to beat \u2014 just a\nchallenge that looks  impossible. So if your hero and your bad guy are not of\nequal strength, make them so, but give the edge to the bad guy. By\nratcheting up the power and invincibility of the bad guy, the hero will have\nto do more that we can admire. Making the bad guy just out of reach of the\nability of the hero to defeat him elevates our hero.\nTURN, TURN, TURN\nThis is another of those slogans that I have written on a faded Post-it\u00ae\nnote. It\u2019s been stuck above my desk for 20 years. It was the first piece of\nwisdom I ever heard about screenwriting and I\u2019ll be damned if I know who\ntold me.\nBut this anonymous advisor has guided me ever since.\nThe basis of the \u201cTurn, Turn, Turn\u201d rule is: The plot doesn\u2019 t just move\nahead, it spins and intensifies as it goes. It is the difference between\nvelocity (a constant speed) and acceleration (an increasing speed). And the\nrule is: It\u2019s not enough for the plot to go forward, it must go forward faster ,\nand with more complexity , to the climax.\nIf things happen in your movie but aren\u2019 t interesting, then all you\u2019ve\ngot is a chase. They go here, they go there, but nothing abou t the chase\nprovokes any activity behind the audience\u2019 s eyeballs. We\u2019re just watching\nstuff happen, but nothing about it is engaging or humanly compelling.\nAnd that\u2019 s\u2026 (Anybody? Anybody?)\u2026 bad. Right.\nLet\u2019s take, for example, a very loud and busy movie, The Cat in the\nHat, starrin g Mike Meyers. Apart from the fact that it\u2019s one of the more\ninappropriate kids\u2019 movies ever made, it\u2019s a great example of lots of\nSTUFF! happening, all over the place, TONS! of action\u2026 without anything\nhappening  at all. It\u2019s kinetic eye candy with no forward motion. It\u2019s a\nCHASE! with no stakes. They go here, they go there, but I don\u2019t give a\ndamn and don\u2019t know why I\u2019m watching. It proves the point that you can\nhave lots of action and still not have a story . It moves forward , but there\u2019 s\nno Turn, T urn, T urn.\nMore must be revealed along every step of the plot about your\ncharacters and what all this action means. T o that end, you, the writer of this\nplot, must show how it affects your characters as you go along. You must\nshow flaws, reveal treacheries, doubts, and fears of the heroes \u2014 and\nthreats to them. You must expose hidden powers, untapped resources, and\ndark motivations for the bad guys that the hero doesn\u2019 t know about. Show\nfacets of that spinning diamond of plot, let the reflected light amaze the\naudience. The diamond cannot merely move across the screen, it must Turn,\nTurn, Turn in order to truly dazzle us. Show us all of it. Let the light play\noff its many sides; let\u2019 s see some of that detail!\nThe same goes for the speed of the plot. As the grip of the bad guy\ntightens around the hero, things happen faster , and the pressure exerted in\nthe vice- like grip of the forces opposing the hero will finally explode in its\nAct Thre e clima x with a rush of energy and emotion. If you don\u2019t feel your\nplot intensifying as you make the midpoint turn and start heading for the\nfinish, you have problems.\nTurn, Turn, Turn reminds us to accelerate and reveal all with verve as\nwe move the plot forward. Turn, Turn, Turn tells us to make the plot more\ndynamic and less inert.\nSo if your screenplay\u2019 s plot feels in any way static or flat, try looking\nat it from its other angles. And make it accelerate, not just move forward.\nMake it T urn, T urn, T urn.\nTHE EMOTIONAL COLOR WHEEL\nWhen they say a good movie is \u201clike a roller -coaster ride,\u201d they mean\nthat as an audien ce member watching the story unfold, your emotions have\nbeen wrung out. You\u2019ve laughed; you\u2019ve cried; you\u2019ve been aroused;\nyou\u2019ve been scared; you\u2019ve felt regret, anger , frustration, near-miss anxiety\nand, ultimately , breathtaking triumph. And when the lights come up, you\nwalk out of the theater feeling absolutely drained.\nWhew! What a movie!\nWhether it\u2019s a comedy or a drama, wringing out the emotions of the\naudience is the name of the game. Making it an emotional exper ience, using\nall the emotions, is what it\u2019s about . Think why that is. We go to the movies\nnot only to escape reality , and to ultimately learn a little lesson  about Life,\nbut to experienc e a dream state where Life and its attendant emotions are\nrecreated in a safe environment. Like a good dream, we must live the\nmovie; we must run in place along with the hero in our sleep , clutch our\npillows at the love scene, and hide under the covers during the breathtaking\nclimax of the film to wake exha usted but fulfilled, wrung out, worked out,\nand satisfied.\nSo your movie doesn\u2019 t have  this, so what? So it\u2019s one-note\nemotionally? If it\u2019s a comedy and it\u2019s funny all the way through, what\u2019 s the\nproblem? If it\u2019s a drama and it\u2019s tense from start to finish, that\u2019s all. What\u2019 s\nwrong with that?\nWell, let\u2019s take a look at two filmmakers I never thought I\u2019d reference\nin any how-to book: the Farrelly Brothers. They write and direct comedies\nlike Something About Mary , Shallow Hal , and Stuck On Y ou, and are known\nfor hilarious, ribald set pieces. But if you think all they are is funny , you\u2019re\nwrong. These guys work it emotionally . In each of their movies they have\nscenes of great fear, scenes of intense longing, scenes of lust, scenes of\nhuman foible. Their movies work because they use every color in the\nemotional color wheel. It\u2019 s not just one-note funny .\nAnd you can do the same.\nIf your script feels one-note emotionally , go back and flesh it out using\nall the colors in the palette. Where is your lust scene? Where is your\nfrustration scene? Where is your scary scene? And if you don\u2019t have these,\ntake a scene that\u2019s just funny or just dramatic and try to play it for one of\nthe missing colors. A good way to do this is to actually choose a color of\neach of the missing emotions and go back and tag certain scenes to change\nthe emotional tone from one type to another . Take those scenes  and use the\nsame action, the same +/-, the same conflict and result, but play it for lust\ninstead of laugh s, jealousy instead of flat-out, stare-down dramatic conflict.\nBy varying the emotions you use, you\u2019ll create a much more rewarding\nexperience for everyone.\nDon\u2019 t believe me? Go and look at any Farrelly Brothers movie.\n\u201cHI HOW ARE YOU I\u2019M FINE\u201d\nFlat dialogue even happens to good movies. But your script will never\nbe a movie if you have dull, lifeless repartee. And when you find yourself\nreading page after page of this \u201cplace-holder\u201d talk, you know  you\u2019re in\ntrouble.\nYou\u2019re bored!\nAnd that is\u2026(W ait for it)\u2026 bad. Absolutely .\n\u201cHi how are you I\u2019m fine\u201d tells us just how boring flat dialogue  can be\nand what a waste of space it is. Flat dialogue is the kind that anyone can\nsay. And odds are that if your script if full of lines that are right out of real\nlife, that ring true but ring dull, you\u2019re not working hard enough to make\nthe characters come to life. Because odds are that if your dialog ue is flat, so\nare the people speaking it.\nEngaging characters talk differently than you and I. They have a way\nof saying things, even the most mundane things, which raise them above the\nnorm. A character \u2019s dialogue is your opportunity to reveal  character and tell\nus who this person is as much as what he is saying. How someone talks is\ncharacter and can highlight all manner of that character \u2019s past, inner\ndemons, and outlook on life.\nEvery time a character speaks is your chance to show that.\nIf you don\u2019t think you have flat dialogue, try a simple trick I learned\nfrom Mike Cheda. After reading one of my early scripts, he broke the news\nto me: \u201cYour characters all talk the same.\u201d Well, naturally I was insulted; I\nwas ticked. And young bullhead  that I was, I did not believe Mike Cheda.\nWhat did he know?!\nThen Mike show ed me this simple Bad Dialogue Test: Take a page of\nyour script and cover up the names of the people speaking. Now read the\nrepartee as it goes back and forth between two or more characte rs. Can you\ntell who is speak ing without seeing the name above the dialogue? The first\ntime I tried it, there in Mike\u2019 s office at Barry & Enright, I was stunned.\nDamn it, he was right. I couldn\u2019 t tell one of my characters from  the others,\nand then and there I figured out something else too: All the characters had\nMY voice!! In a good script, every  character must speak differentl y. Every\ncharacter must have a unique way of saying even the most mundane \u201cHi\nHow are you I\u2019m fine\u201d kind of chat.\nMy best learning experience in this regard was an early draft of a script\ncalled Big, Ugly Baby! , an alien-switched-at-birth comedy . I gave every\ncharacter a verbal tic. One stuttered, one did malapropisms, one was an\nOkie versed in Sartre, and the Alien parents (my favorite characters) always\nyelled, a point I reinforced by having at least one word in every sentence\nthey spoke CAP ITALIZED! While you don\u2019t have to be this drastic in your\nscript, that exercise showed me how I could make characters richer . (And\nmore fun to read out loud, btw.) I had learned that amping up even the most\n\u201cHi how are you I\u2019m fine\u201d kind of dialogue revealed everything about each\nof my characters and made the read 100% better .\nTAKE A STEP BACK\nI have just been involved in 10 months of rewrites. My partner\nSheldon and I were working on our Golden Fleece and it took seven \u2014\ncount \u2019em seven \u2014 drafts to get it right. One of the reasons it took so long\nis that we had made a basic mistake. W e had broken the rule of \u201cT ake a Step\nBack.\u201d Just so you know , it happens to everybody \u2014 even the pros.\nAs mentioned in Chapter Four, our story is about a kid who is kicked\nout of military school and sent home only to find that his parents have\nmoved away without telling him. So our kid hero goes on the road and has\nlots of fun adventures where he interacts with people and helps them,\nbecause he\u2019s a good kid who causes flowers to bloom and changes the lives\nof strangers wherever he goes. Our mistake was that the way we had\ncreated the character \u2014 a nice kid who helps others \u2014 didn\u2019t give him\nanywhere to go. Our hero had already changed. He didn\u2019 t need this journey .\nHe was the same person he was at the beginning that he was at the end. And\nthe fixing of that problem, draft by draft, took forever . Each draft was about\ntaking him back a step emotionally so the journey means something. Okay ,\na little bit furthe r, okay let\u2019s take him all the way back!  It seems easy now,\nbut in the middle of it, we couldn\u2019 t figure it out. We couldn\u2019 t see that what\nwe needed to do was take our hero back as far as possible, so that the story\nwould be about his growth. And believe it or not, this kind of mistake\nhappens all the time.\nA lot of us know where our heroes end up and don\u2019t want to put them\nthrough the torment of growth, so we avoid the pain for them. And just like\nraising a child, you can\u2019t do that. These characters have to grow by getting\nbumped on the nose, and whether we like it or not, we have to let them. In\nour case, Sheldon and I liked our hero so much and wanted him to come out\nin the end being upbeat, positiv e, and special \u2014 but we didn\u2019 t want to see\nhis struggle to become that. It was like reading the answers at the back of\nthe book without doing the work on the test questions. We wanted to get\nthere so badly , we didn\u2019 t see that getting there was the story . And showing\nthe bumps along the way made the pay-of f greater .\nTake a Step Back applies to all your characters. In order to show how\neveryone grows  and changes in the course of your story , you must take\nthem all back to the starting point. Don\u2019 t get caught up in the end result and\ndeny us the fun of how they get there. We want to see it happen. To\neveryone.\nThis is just one more example of how movies must show the audience\neverything: all the change, all the growth, all the action of a hero\u2019 s journey .\nBy taking it all back as far as possible, by drawing the bow back to its very\nquivering end point, the flight of the arrow is its strongest, longest, and best.\nThe T ake a Step Back rule double-checks this.\nIf you feel like your story or any of its characters isn\u2019t showing  us the\nentire flight, the entire journey\u2026 T ake a Step Back and show it all to us. W e\nwant to see it.\nA LIMP AND AN EYE P ATCH\nSometimes in a screenplay , the basics are done, your hero and bad guy\nare great, the plot explodes and intensifies after the midpoint, and\neverybody\u2019 s got snappy dialogue. Everything\u2019 s great except for one small\nproblem: There seem to be too many minor characters. It\u2019s hard to tell one\nfrom another . Readers will confu se that guy with this other guy. And it bugs\nyou! Isn\u2019 t it obvious?!\nWhat has happened is that you have not given us a hook to hang our\nhats on for each of the characters that are vital to your story . And while we\noften rationalize this by saying \u201cOh well, they\u2019ll handle that in casting!\u201d\nI\u2019ve got one word for you: Ha! You won\u2019 t see casting if your reader can\u2019t\nsee characters. But there\u2019 s an easy way to solve this:\nMake sure every character has \u201cA Limp and an Eyepatch.\u201d\nEvery character has to have a unique way of speaking, but also\nsomething memorable that will stick him in the reader \u2019s mind.  The reader\nhas to have a visual clue, often a running visual reminder , which makes\nremembering a character easier . A Limp and an Eyepatch may seem like a\nsilly way to think about how to attach traits to characters to make sure we\nremember them, but it works \u2014 if you remember to do it.\nOften the realization that you need something like this comes from a\nreader . A great example of A Limp and an Eyepatch happened  to me and\nshows just how amazing this simple device can be. Sheldon and I were\nwriting our ill-fa ted Really Mean Girls . We had one character , the lead boy,\nwho has a crush on our lead girl and acts as the \u201cSpeake r of Truth\u201d\nwhenever he is around, keeping the lead girl on the straight and narrow with\nhis moral compass. He\u2019 s a funny kid, mature beyond his years, the type who\nwill be a sterling adult but right now is \u201ctoo smart for his own good.\u201d He\nwas vital to the plot, but somehow unmemorable on the page. Our manager ,\nAndy Cohen, read draft after draft and kept getting stuck on the boy. Who\nwas he? Yes, he had an importan t function, but why was he interesting? We\ntried changing dialogue, making  him funnier , smarter , but still got the same\nnote.\nFinally , Sheldon  came up with a brilliant fix. When we meet the boy\nfor the first time, we described him as wearing a black t-shirt and sporting a\nwispy soul-patch on his chin. Emblematically it fit, showing his yearning to\nbe hip and older on the inside and not quite cutting it in his appearance.\nAnd every time he appeared we referenced this. We gave the script back to\nAndy , and he called us to say he didn\u2019 t know what we\u2019d done but the\ncharacter of the boy really popped for him now. The boy jumped off the\npage and registe red in his mind. We had done very little overall , he was the\nsame kid, we just gave him A Limp and an Eyepatch.\nAnd it made all the dif ference.\nIs this technique \u201cfake\u201d or \u201cartifice\u201d? No, it\u2019s screenwriting. It\u2019s the\njob. So when you find yourself with one or several unidentifiable characters\nwho are getting lost in the shuf fle, try saying what I say now all the time:\nI think this guy needs A Limp and an Eyepatch.\nIS IT PRIMAL?\nI have used the term \u201cprimal\u201d throughout this book. To me it is my\ntouchstone both in creating a script and fixing it once it\u2019s done. \u201cIs it\nprimal?\u201d is a question I ask from the beginning to the end of a project, and\nmaking it more primal is the name of the game. To ask \u201cIs It Primal?\u201d or\n\u201cWould a Caveman Understand?\u201d is to ask if you are connecting with the\naudience at a basic level. Does your plot hinge on primal drives like\nsurvival, hunger , sex, protection of loved ones, or fear of death?  At the root\nof anyone\u2019 s goal in a movie must be something that basic, even if on its\nsurface it seems to be about something else. By making what drives your\ncharacters more  primal, you\u2019ll not only ground everything that happens in\nprinciples that connect in a visce ral way, you also make it easier to sell your\nstory all over the world.\nThink about it.\nEveryone in China \u201cgets\u201d a love story . Everyone in South America\nunderstands a Jaws  or an Alien  because \u201cDon\u2019 t Get Eaten\u201d is primal \u2014\neven without snappy dialogue.\nBut this can also go for little fixes of minor characters or subplo ts in a\nscript that\u2019s not working. Are these characters motivated by primal drives?\nIt\u2019s another way of saying: Are these characters acting like recognizable\nhuman beings? At their core, they must be. Or else you are not addressing\nprimal issues.\nLet\u2019s say you have a high-falutin\u2019 concept: stockbrokers rigging the\ninternational bond market. Fine. All very interesting. But at its core, no\nmatter what the plot is, by making each character \u2019s desire more primal, that\nplot is grounded  in a reality that everyone can understand \u2014 suddenly it\u2019s\nnot about stockbrokers, it\u2019 s about human beings trying to survive.\nHere are primal drives in the storylines of a few hit films:\n \n> The desire to save one\u2019 s family ( Die Har d)\n> The desire to protect one\u2019 s home ( Home Alone )\n> The desire to find a mate ( Sleepless in Seattle )\n> The desire to exact revenge ( Gladiator )\n> The desire to survive ( Titanic )\nEach of these is about a primal need that might be better seen as a\nbiological need,  the prime direct ive. The desire to win the lottery is, in fact,\nthe desire to have more food, more wives, make more children, to be able to\nreproduce at will. The desire for revenge is, in fact, the desire to knock off a\ncompeting DNA  carrier and propel your own DNA forward. The desire to\nfind one\u2019s paren t or child is the desire to shore up and defend existing DNA\nand survive.\nYou may think your story is about something more \u201csophisticated\u201d\nthan this; it\u2019s not. At its core it must be about something that resonates at a\ncaveman level.\nAll together now: When in doubt ask, \u201cIs It Primal?\u201d\nSUMMAR Y\nSo now you\u2019ve seen how you can double-check your work using\nsimple rules of the road. If your script feels flat or if you get back\ncomments from  readers who can\u2019t quite put their finger on it, but know\nsomething\u2019 s wrong, here are seven easy thought-starters to help you find the\nweak spot.\nAnd fix it.\nAsk yourself these questions, the \u201cIs It Broken?\u201d T est:\n \n1. Does my hero lead the action? Is he proactive at every stage of\nthe game and fired up by a desire or a goal?\n2. Do my characters \u201ctalk the plot\u201d? Am I saying things a novelist\nwould say throu gh my characters instead of letting it be seen in the\naction of my screenplay?\n3. Is the bad guy bad enough? Does he offer my hero the right kind\nof challenge? Do they both belong in this movie?\n4. Does my plot move faster and grow more intense after the\nmidpoint? Is more revealed about the hero and the bad guy as we come\nin to the Act Three finale?\n5. Is my script one-note emotionally? Is it all drama? All comedy ?\nAll sadness? All frustration? Does it feel like it needs, but does not\noffer, emotion breaks?\n6. Is my dialogue flat? After doing the Bad Dialogue Test does it\nseem like everyone talks the same? Can I tell one character from\nanother just by how he or she speaks?\n7. Do my minor characters stand out from each other , and are they\neasy to differentiate by how they look in the mind\u2019 s eye? Is each\nunique in speech, look, and manner?\n8. Does the hero\u2019 s journey start as far back as it can go? Am I seein g\nthe entire length of the emotional growth of the hero in this story?\n9. Is it primal? Are my characters, at their core, reaching out for a\nprimal desire \u2014 to be loved, to survive, to protect family , to exact\nrevenge?\nIf you are having any nagging doubts about any of the above, you now\nknow what to do. You have the tools to go back in and fix it. But will you?\nThat\u2019 s the rub. Here\u2019 s a tip: When in doubt, do it. Odds are that if you, or\nyour initial batch of readers, have found problems with your screenplay ,\neveryone else will too. Don\u2019 t be lazy! Don\u2019 t say \u201cOh well, no one will\nnotice\u201d because\u2026 they will. It is better to be brilliant now and have the guts\nto fix your mistakes before your script\u2019 s sitting on Steven Spielber g\u2019s desk.\nYou only get the one shot at a first impression. Try to get over the love\naffair you have with yourself and your work (God knows I\u2019ve been in love\nwith my own a thousand times !!) and do what needs to be done. This is\nwhat separates the pros from the wannabes \u2014 that nagging voice that says:\n\u201cIt sucks !\u201d And the mature, adult, professional voice that quickl y chimes in:\n\u201cAnd I know how to fix it!\u201d\nEXERCISES\n \n1. Go back over your list of movie s in your favorite genre, pick one\nthat feels weak, and use the Is It Broken? Test to see if it can be\nimproved.\n2. Take another of your favorite  movies from your genre and\nexamine the hero/bad guy relationship. Imagine torquing this\nrelationship out of whack by making the bad guy less powerful or\nordinary . Does this simple change make the hero less interesting too?\n3. Try \u201ctalking the plot\u201d in real life. Seriously . Go to a party or meet\nwith a group of friends and say: \u201cI sure am glad I\u2019m a screenwriter\nwho was born in Chicago!\u201d or \u201cGosh, you\u2019ve been my friend for 20\nyears ever since we met in High School!\u201d See what reaction you get to\nthis kind of dialogue.\nAnd so we come to the end of our screenwriting confab.\nWe\u2019ve discussed many relevant topics and while I\u2019ve been writing this\nbook, and working on screenplays of my own thank you very much, a lot\nhas happened out here in Hollywoodland:\n \n> Sequels have met with mixed success.\n> Many pre-sold franchises did well but some died miserable\ndeaths.\n> The open-hu ge-in\u2013the-first-week strategy (3,000+ theater s)\neven-if-you-drop-70%-80%-in-the-second-week of a film\u2019 s release still\nrecouped a majority of most films\u2019 budgets, assuring this tactic will\ncontinue.\n> And family films outperform ed every other type of movie, a\ntruism that was met with the resounding sound of\u2026 crickets\u2026 by the\nZegna-suited slicksters. (It\u2019s hard to be cool at the cocktail party  when\nyou make \u2014 ugh! \u2014 PG flicks.)\nIn short,  it\u2019s more than interesti ng; it\u2019s a boom time, a gold rush. And\nthe most  importa nt thing for you to know is that it\u2019s still a highl y profitable\nbusiness with lots of reason to invest in new talent. So here is the good\nnews and bad news as it relates to your spec screenplay .\nThe good news is: The studios have money to buy your script. And the\nlack of stellar success in the pre-sold franchise arena should indicate they\nneed you. More than ever they must have original ideas. So buying your\nspec makes sense.\nThe bad news is: They attrib ute all their success to them selves.\nShrewder marketing, better accounting, more control over how ideas get\nturned into movies \u2014 that\u2019s how they did it, ladies and gentlemen! God\nlove \u2019em! Studio executives keep praying for the sun to rise and each dawn\nassume it was their prayers that made it happen.\nBut this should not deter you. If you have gotten anything out of this\nbook, it\u2019s that selling a script has a lot more to do with think ing of your\nscreenplay as a \u201cbusiness plan\u201d  than ever before. If you have a creative\napproach, you too can sell to Hollywood. And if you do, you have a bright\nfuture. A catchy logline and a killer title will get you noticed. A well-\nstructured scree nplay will keep you in the game, and knowing how to fix\nyour script \u2014 and any other script you may be presented with \u2014 will get\nyou a career . If you have mastered the demands of the job as outlined in this\nbook, you will win at this game.\nBut we are getting ahead of ourselves?\nHow , you may ask, do you even get in the door?!\nAMBITION VS. F ATE\nBefore the first class is over, invariably I will be asked the one burning\nquestion on every screenwriter \u2019s mind:\n\u201cHow do I get an agent?\u201d\nWould you belie ve me if I told you that it\u2019s all luck? Would you call\nme crazy if I advised you not to worry about it, that it will happen when it\nhappens? Probably not. But that may be because I am very comfortable\nwith the subject of how to sell myself. I personally love the business of\nmarketing my scripts and me. I am not afraid to pick up the phone, meet\nsomeone at a party, and actually call them the next day (if they give me\ntheir card) or finagle friends to get me introductions to people I think would\nlike to meet me.\nI think I have something to offer. I like the business and I like meeting\nthe people in it. And the worst thing that can happen, I figure, is that\nsomeone will say \u201cno.\u201d\nSo here are two stories about how I got my first agents. One is a\ndemonstration of ambition, one an example of fate.\nI got my first agent by sheer pluck. My friends and I had written and\nproduced a TV pilot called The Blank Show . A funny parody of what was\nthen the brand-new phenomenon of cable TV, we had made it on a\nshoestring and once we were done with it, we didn\u2019 t know what to do. I\nvolunteered to market it mysel f. I came to Los Angeles, submitted it to\nPublic Access TV, and got a commitment for a day and time it would air.\nThen for weeks I plastered the westside (where I assumed producers lived)\nwith fliers telling the day and time our show would be on. It finally ran one\nSunday night and, sure enough, the next day, Monday morning,  I got a call\nfrom the producing partner of Budd Friedman, owner of the Improv . He\nloved our show! Would my friends and I be interested in being represented?\nI arrang ed to have my gang of cohorts come to Los Angeles for a meeting\nwith Budd, who offered to manage us there and then. A little luck and\nambition had gotten us noticed. And while our comedy troupe eventually\nbroke up, I have maintained my friendship with Budd Friedman to this day .\nThat\u2019 s what \u201cworking it\u201d can do, so you should always be working it.\nBut here\u2019 s where fate is better .\nMy next agent, and the best one I ever had, I met through\ncircumstances that were much more serendipitous. On a break from my\nduties as a Production Assistant for a sitcom called Teachers Only  at NBC, I\ndecided to go home to Santa Barbara for the weekend. And even though I\nwas tired from the drive, I was restless. I decided to go to a local club to get\na drink and hopefully meet girls. And I did. I met a girl I was smitten with\non sight, and who eventually became my girlfriend. No, she wasn\u2019 t an\nagent. But her best friend wanted to be one. I hit it off with her, too. And\nwhen she was promoted to agent at Writers & Artists, I was one of the first\npeople she asked to be her client. I immediately said yes.\nAnd that\u2019s how I came to be represented by Hilary Wayne. All because\nI stopped in to have a drink at a bar .\nHilary and I went on to have a fabulous relationship. She was the best\nagent I ever had. She made great deals for me, understood my writing and\nmy ability to conceptualize, and she formed the foundation of my entire\ncareer . Though she herself was new to the game, she had a real knack not\njust for selling but also for positioning both script and writer in the\nmarketplace. Hilary knew how to build careers and she built mine from\nscratch. Our relationship coincided with that point in Hollyw ood history\nwhen the \u201cspec sale\u201d was king.  This was a time when studio heads would\nknock themselv es out to take a virgin script away from another studio;\nthey\u2019d bid the price up into the millions to do so. And Hilary was a master\nat setting up these grudge matches, pitting executive against executive, and\nengineering sales that became the headline on next day\u2019s front page of\nVariety .\nWhat I had found in Hilary was not just an agent, but a partner . What\nmade it work was that we were on the same wavelength; we were both\nhungry to succeed, and went out of our way to respect the mark etplace and\ndeliver to it what we thought it needed. We read the tea leaves, I went back\nand made product, and she sold the product. And we made millions of\ndollars doing it. Hilary passed away in 1998 or I would still be working\nwith her. And I often wonder what she would make of the business today .\nThe landscape has changed and the spec sale fever is no longer what it was,\nbut Hollywood still needs good ideas and good writers. No matter how you\nfind your way in this maze, you must be bold. And you must find your own\nHilary W ayne because you can\u2019 t do it alone.\nIt\u2019s one thing for me to tell you my tales, it\u2019s another to ask what I\nwould do if I were starting out again or if I wanted to find new\nrepresentation and sell myself from scratch today . I am lucky \u2014 I don\u2019t\nmind getting out from behind my computer and meeting people. Not every\none of you is like that. As writers we tend to be insular , introverted, and\nintrospective. But if you want to sell your script, you have to sell yourself\n\u2014 and I say this in the most healthy and positive sense. There is no crass\nsalesmanship involved if you are genuinely interested in your subject. And\nif you seek out people to be partners in this game, whom you can help as\nmuch as they can help you, then it\u2019 s mutually beneficial.\nThat\u2019 s always been my attitude, anyway .\nSo maybe I can plant a few positive visualizations in your brain and\nyou can see yourself following through on a few of them. Beca use being a\ntalented screenwriter , and writi ng even the most perfect scrip t, is only a\nsmall part of what will be needed to get you where you want to go. You will\nneed to get out of your workro om and mingle. You will have to put on a\nclean shirt and shine your shoes and smile.\nPREP ARING THE FIELD\nLike any well-plotted story with a (hopefully) happy ending, you must\nmake a plan and follow it step by step.\nHere\u2019 s what you\u2019ve got:\nYou\u2019ve got you, a screenwriter with x number of scripts to your credit,\nvarying degrees of success in selling them, and a great big crush  on movies\nand moviemakers.\nYou\u2019ve got your product \u2014 your best screenplay \u2014 and several\npitches (even if they\u2019re for screenplays you\u2019ve already written), and if\nyou\u2019ve followed  the advice of Chapter One, your loglines and titles are\nkiller \u2014 and ready to go.\nYou\u2019ve even got a rough idea of what you need next: An agent who\nwill help you sell these projects, and producers who will either buy them\nfrom you or go into partnership  with you to get these projects set up, sold,\nand made into movies.\nIf you don\u2019 t have that list, start making one:\n \n> Go on the Internet and check out the Hollywood Creative\nDirectory ( www .hcdonline.com ); if you feel like shelling out $50 or so,\nget a copy (you should). Read that thing and get to know it. Production\ncompanies, contact names, fellow writers, and producers with projects\nin your genre is the place to start.\n> Likew ise pick up a copy of the HCD Talent Agency directo ry\nand make a similar list. Include agents at big agencies and small, who\nlike the same movies you like.\nAnd now , you must start being really clever .\nTHA T SOUL-EA TING FIRST CONT ACT\nYou can contact  anyone by letter, you can camp out on doorsteps and\nstalk your victim s, you can produce The Blank Show  and get it on L.A.\nPublic Access and wait for the phone to ring, but whatever your method,\nslowly and surely, you must introduce you and your product to \u201cthem.\u201d In\nmy opinion, making it about you first is the key. Making it personal, letting\nthem meet and know you, is the best way to make the introduction to your\nwork. My genius agent Hilary always said, and it should be on a plaque in\nthe Hall of Fame: Every Sale Has a Story! The story is you. But how are\nyou going to get that story told to the people on your list? W ell:\n \n> In person  is better than a phone call\u2026\n> A phone call  is better than a query letter\u2026\n> A query letter  is better than an e-mail\u2026\n> And an e-mail  (from a stranger) is usually when I push\nDELETE on my computer \u2014 unless I\u2019ve been forewarned that it\u2019s\ncoming or it can do something for me today .\nThe key to all of this is to not think so much about your immediate\ngoals but your long-term ones. Sure you need an agent, right now! But you\nalso need to build a reputation. If you are lucky enough to have a career ,\nyou will be bumping into these people again and again for years. So try not\nto burn any bridges, or at least try not to burn them all the way down. Be\nnice. Be considerate. Be helpful. Be upbeat.\nBut keep knocking on doors and showing your face.\nTry to put yourself in the shoes of everyone you speak to. What is it\nthat they want? How can you make dealing with you easier on them? And\nwhat are they going to get out of the interaction that will make meeting you\nworth their time?\nOne of the golden rules is it\u2019s easier to get an agent when you have a\ndeal that needs closing. And it is also easier to pitch you if someone has\nalready bought something from you. This is why I always recommend that\nif any legitimate entity wants to option your screenplay , even for little\nmoney , and no one else has offered you anything \u2014 grab it. I can\u2019t tell you\nthe value of having someone go first. And having projects in process, no\nmatter how minor in terms of money up front, tells others you don\u2019t have\nthe plague. It also gives you something to talk about when you meet new\npeople.\nSo now you know what you\u2019re selling and whom you want to sell to.\nBut how can you make your proposal different? How can you catch the eye\nof someone who gets proposals all the time? Would you blanch if I told you\nit was just a matter of turning the crank again and again until something\nhappens?\nBecause that\u2019 s all it takes.\nJust keep turning the crank. Any inroad, any one at all, is a gigantic\nleap forward. And while you may not get an agent right away , or make a\nsale right away , you are making progress every time you write a query\nletter , pick up the phone, or meet someone for coffee. Here are a few signs\nthat you are making progress in marketing you:\n \n> An agent or producer says your project is not for him, but to\nkeep him in mind for future scripts.\n> You talk to an agent or producer that you like. This is a sign,\nfellow pilgrims! It is just as important for you to feel chemistry with\nhim as his feelin g chemistry with you. You\u2019ve identified someone you\nwill want to get in touch with again, even if it\u2019 s \u201cno\u201d now .\n> You have whittled a list of 50 possibles down to three maybe s.\nThose 47 no\u2019s had to be gotten through. Every no is one step closer to\na yes. But by God you did the work! The yes is that much nearer .\n> You get a referral. Everyone  you contact must be asked this\nquestion at some point in the process of saying no: \u201cIs there anyone\nelse you can recommend that I contact about my career?\u201d Referrals ar e\ngold* and everyone I know is thrilled to oblige with one. Believe it or\nnot, people want to help you succeed.\nNETWORKING\nWhen the agent and producer route has been thoroughly sifted through,\nwhere else can you go to get help? It is who you know , damn it. So how are\nyou going to reach out? Well, these things can be done \u2014 even without an\nagent:\n \n> Film Festivals  \u2013 There\u2019 s one in your town or somewhere close\nenough to attend. Go there. Get business cards, pitch your script, hear\nother pitches. A contact is a contact and every person you meet knows\n30 other people. Keep in touch postfestival and ask for referrals.\nFigure out how you can return the favor . Ask how you can help with\ntheir  projects.\n> Classes  \u2013 Go where other screenwriters go, but also go where\naspiring producers go. Near me at UCLA there\u2019 s a Producer \u2019s Seminar\nevery semester \u2014 what a great place for a writer to go to meet the next\nwave of young hotshot producers in town. The local university in your\ntown probably has similar courses.\n> Screenwriting Gr oups  \u2013 There  are lots of these online , as well\nas in local comm unities. And I belong to one of the best, a savvy little\nbunch of scribbl ers called The Screenplayers (www .screenplayers.net ).\nThese are bands of screenwri ters pooling their resources to help\nthemselves and each other . If the group is set up right, one of you will\nbe a comedy maven, another a devotee of horror , etc. Maybe one\nknows a producer who can\u2019t help him but can help you. If you don\u2019t\nknow of any groups, check out the Net or start one yourself.\n> Become An Expert  \u2013 You like movies so much, well start\nreviewing movi es. Do it in your local paper or online. The career of\ndirector/writer Rod Lurie started in this way. Likewise Fran\u00e7ois\nTruffaut. At some point, someo ne realized these two guys knew  what\nthey were talking about and gave them a chance to make their own\nfilms. By becoming critics, they had a platform from which  to be\nheard. And when  the time came  to put their money where their mouths\nwere, they were ready with their own scripts and projects.\n> Come to Los Angeles  \u2013 Whet her you come out for a week or a\nlifetime, L.A. is where the busin ess is, so what are you doing living in\nDubuque? If I were starting all over again, I would come to L.A. and\nget any job, preferably one as a script reader . I would read as many\nscripts and make as many contacts as I could while keepi ng my\nscreenwriting going on the side. If I could only come out for a week, I\nwould be available for as many meetings as possible with producers;\nindustry get-togethers at SAG, DGA, WGA; and be ready with my bio,\nbusiness card, sample scripts, treatments, and photo so they remember\nmy face. What\u2019 s stopping you?\n> You.com  \u2013 Thou gh I have not tried this route \u2014 not yet\nanyway \u2014 how about starting  a Web site all about you and your\ncareer? Put up your photo and bio. List scripts in progress, treatments,\nand sample pages that are available to download, and even details of\ndeals in progres s with referrals to those you\u2019re in business with (with\ntheir permission, of course). You.com  is a great thing to reference and\nput on a busine ss card. You want to know who I am? Check out my\nWeb site.\nDON\u2019T TR Y THIS A T HOME\u2026\nKnowing what to do is as impo rtant as knowing what not to do. Here\nare a few things that people advise that I think are less beneficial.\nRemember the key ingredient in marketing yourself is to meet people \u2014\nface to face if possible, so the following seem like busy work to me:\n \n> Screenplay Contests  \u2013 This is something I\u2019m going to get\nskewered for but I just have to say it: I think screenwriting contests are\na colossal waste of time. It\u2019s a trend that\u2019s been springing up of late,\nand many writers live and die by the results, waiting by the phone or\nthe mail box to see if they made it to the top 10% tier \u2014 whatever that\nis. I have one word for such activity: Stop. It means just about zero to\nany agen t or producer with anything real going on. It\u2019s nice if you like\ncontests; to me, it\u2019s an echo chamber . Do they give you any money for\nthese contests? Are they going to make your film with an A-lis t cast?\nNo! ! I haven\u2019 t seen one script from one contest get turned into a Tom\nCruise movie, have you? And we are here to sell our scripts to the likes\nof B.O. stars like him. Are we together on this? Good!\nOn the other hand\u2026 there are some contests that sponsor panels\nof experts who have actually sold to or work for the majors. These\nprofessionals can offer invaluable learning and networking\nopportunities. So if you must enter a contest, you have a job to do first:\nRead carefully . Ask questions. Seek out the legitimate, the ones with\nhigh-level pros who will be available at panels and/or seminars. If\nthey\u2019re not associated with the contest, you shouldn\u2019 t be either .\n> Stupid Screenwriter Tricks  \u2013 However clever we think we\nare, sometimes we go too far in our enthusiasm. W e are creative people\nand think every one will get it \u2014 well, they don\u2019t. Stunts don\u2019t work.\nLame attempts to get attention don\u2019t work. Here are some other don\u2019ts:\nDon\u2019 t package yourself in a big crate and mail yourself to William\nMorris. Don\u2019 t take out a full-page advertisement in Variety  with your\npicture and phone number with the slogan: Will Write for Food. Don\u2019 t\nhave your picture taken with a cut-out photo of your favorite movie\nstar and send to him autographed with the phrase: We should be in\nbusiness together! And whatever you do, don\u2019t threaten to leap off the\nHollywood sign as leverage to get someone to read your screenplay .\nIt\u2019s been done, babe, it\u2019 s been done.\nSOME MARKETING HITS AND MISSES\nI would be remiss in my advice on how to sell yourself and your\nscreenplay if I didn\u2019 t give you examples of things that I\u2019ve done \u2014 some\nworked and some didn\u2019 t \u2014 to get my screenplays sold. I have tried it all.\nTake these for what they\u2019re worth and try them at your peril.\nIn the area of \u201cspecialty pitches,\u201d I can tell you some good stories,\nincluding doing  so well in one meeting with my longtime friend and co-\nwriter , the fabulously funny Tracey Jackson, that producer David Permut\nflew us to New York the next day to pitch our idea to Howard  Stern. You\nhear of these amazing presentations; some producers and write rs are better\nat it and more successful than others. And they\u2019re certainly fun to know\nabout. One of the best at it is producer David Kirschner (Chucky , An\nAmerican Tail). David has made it his person al specialty to be able to line\nup pitch  meeting s at the top studios and really put on a show . When David\nhad the rights to the \u201950s TV series Leave it to Beaver , and went in to\nUniversal to pitch the movie, he brought a surprise guest. During David\u2019 s\npitch, there was a knock at the door and Barbara Billingsley , the original\nMrs. Cleaver, came in to serve executives milk and cookies. David took his\npitch to exactly one studio.\nDeal!\nFor his pitch to Disney to sell the Bette Midler movie Hocus Pocus ,\nDavid created a spooky , effects-laden coven complete with actresses\ndressed as witches to enhance the mood. In this atmosphere, David wove\nhis own selling spell. By the time he was done, the Disney execs were\nbewitched.\nDeal!\nMaybe the king of the logline working today , the man with a thousand\npitches at his command, is producer Bob Kosber g. Bob makes a sale or two\nevery month. He\u2019s amazing. Working with writers on ideas of his own, and\ntheirs too, he can conceptualize  better than anyone in the business and can\nweed out the clunkers from the winners with lightning speed. Every time he\nwalks into the room, he has a new one to pitch.\nDeal!\nI, too, have done specialty pitches. The one I remember most was a\nhilarious failure.  My first partne r, Howard Burkons, and I had a movie idea\ncalled B.M.O.C ., which was basically Tootsie  on a college campus. Howard\nvolunteered to do the pitch dressed as a woman, in full makeup  and outfit,\njust to get the idea across that it was possible. And as great as Howard looks\nin a dress, we did not sell B.M.O.C .\nNo deal!\nHoward did, however , get asked out at Disney .\nI have had success with specialty marketing. During the spec sale\nfrenzy of the early \u201990s, the buzz surrounding any virgin screenplay that\nwas on the block for sale was huge. Word that a new script was going \u201cout\nto the town\u201d started days and weeks beforehand. The script was tracked  by\ndevelopment execs, and their bosses often yelled and screamed demanding\nto be put on the list.\nIn this atmosphere, making your script sale special became a fad. For\nthe sale of a script called Ticking Man, ticking clocks with alarms all set to\nthe same time were sent out to executives prior to getting the script. The\nalarms went off all over town at the moment messengers arriv ed with the\nscript. T alk about building and paying of f tension!\nThe Nuclear Family  Script Containment Unit (1992)\nWhen Jim Haggin and I were ready to send out our spec script,\nNuclear Family , we decided to package it in artistically    designed\n\u201cradioactive script containment units,\u201d into which we stuck the script as our\nway of setting the mood. We made 20 of these from materials we bought at\nan Army surplus store; only the most special producers were on the list to\nget one. After clearing this special delivery with the security gate at every\nstudio (these things looked so much like a bomb we didn\u2019 t want any false\nred alerts), the send-out was coordinated by our agent, Hilary , as\nmessengers delivered our script containment units in a flurry of activity all\nover town. By the time the day was over, Jeffery Katzenber g at Disney and\nSteven Spielber g at Amblin had personally gotten on the phone to make a\nbid.\nA year or so later, Colby Carr and I stuffed several dozen kid\u2019s\nbackpacks with a million dollars  in play money for Hilary to send out Blank\nCheck  \u2014 basically the storyline of the script in a finely made, 3-D souvenir .\nBlank Check  backpacks (1993)\nEach of these specialty presentations resulted in a million-dolla r sale.\nAnd headlines in Variety  the next day noted the marketing innovations and\nthe bidding war both inspired. For our part, we always devised these\nbecause we were genuinely enthusiastic about our script, and wanted to get\nthe reader in the mood \u2014 just like a good marketing campaign gets a\nnationwide audience in the mood to see a summer blockbuster . It\u2019s a truism\nthat the easiest people to sell are salesmen. I am a sucker for a great\ncampaign of any kind. And so are the executives in Hollywood. They like a\ngood show as much as the next person and are more likely to applaud the\neffort. Besides, we had a ball doing it!\nOf course this kind of marketing is oldhat now . No one does these little\ntricks anymore. It\u2019s doubtful this type of selling will come back. Too many\nscripts that were bought did not get made and the spec script craze has died.\nStudios nowada ys don\u2019t like to be that out of control when it comes to\nbidding on scripts, so they don\u2019t get into bidding wars as often or as eagerly\nas they used to. But it was fun while it lasted! Who knows what the next\ninnovative tactic  will be \u2014 via the Internet maybe? \u2014 to get the attention\nthat will set your script apart in the crowd. After all, this is a business that\nstill likes special ef fects, surprise, and showmanship.\nIT IS WHA T IT IS\nOkay . Last words on the entire subject. I am a little teary about ending\nthis book. It\u2019s been fun to write and I hope that in some way it\u2019s been\nhelpful to you. I have been honored to be a part of this business from the\ntime I was a very little kid. I\u2019ve had great adventures, lots of truly creative\nmoments, and met some of the most amazing people. It\u2019 s been a great ride.\nI\u2019ve also been faced with terrible self-doubt and self-recrimination.\nYou get bumped  in this business , and want to throw in the towe l from time\nto time. But if it\u2019s in your blood, like it\u2019s in mine, you learn to persevere.\nAnd you get as much education  from failure as success. If you keep trying\nand stay focused, you can have any prize in the firmament. All you have to\ndo is keep working at it, have a great attitude, and know that today just\nmight be \u201cthe day .\u201d\nRight before Colby Carr and I ever sent a script out, gave it to our\nagent, or to the producer , we had a little saying to take the sting away . We\nknew that we had done our best. With Colby , as with all my writing\npartners, we work hard for the money . And we are harder on ourselves than\nany critic could possibly be. Just before we dropped that script in the mail\nor surrendered it to the messeng er, Colby and I would say: \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d\nThat phrase means that certain  artistic projects, when combined with the\nneed for those projects to make a profit, are penned in by deman ds that you\nmust meet. If you meet them satisfactorily , if you\u2019ve done your job, if\nyou\u2019ve covered yourself from every angle, if you\u2019ve met every  criteria and\ndone so creatively , that\u2019 s all you can do. Y ou\u2019ve done your best.\nThe rest is fate.\nIt is what it is.\nThe business is what it is too. And while I often rebel against it, or try\nto bullhead my way past it, there\u2019s no way around it. \u201cThey ,\u201d meaning the\npeople who run the studios and make the decisions, do all kinds of things\nthat drive creativ e people like us mad, but they are in charge. Yes, they buy\ninto someone\u2019 s \u201cheat\u201d and ignore others, more talented, who are unknown.\nThey often don\u2019t read scripts thoroughly . And they are more interested in\nthe headline and the opportunity you represent than your growth as an artist.\nBut that\u2019 s the nature of business.\nIt is what it is.\nYou must find a life within the confines of \u201cIt is what it is.\u201d This is\nwhere your skills as a bullhead will save both you and your sanity . And\nwhile I\u2019ve made fun of this trait throughout this book, I do it as a means of\nchallenging you to be more so: Whatever you do, don\u2019t stop being a\nbullhead. The powers-that-be can take away a lot of things. They can buy\nyour script and fire you, or rewrite it into oblivion, but they can\u2019t take away\nyour ability to get up off the mat and come back swinging \u2014 better and\nsmarter than you were before.\nMost of all, you must try to find the fun in everything you write.\nBecause having fun lets you know you\u2019re on the right track. So that when\nyou write those two dazzling words, FADE IN:, the hundredth time, you\u2019re\nas excited as you were when you wrote them the first.\n* This is how I got hired as a page at NBC. I cold-called a\nproducer for a job. I met with him, he had nothing for me, but the\nmeeting went so well he called his friend at NBC and got me an\ninterview . The producer had been a page himself.\nGLOSSARY\nFREQUENT TERMS IN USE IN THE 310 AREA\nCODE\nARC  \u2013 This denotes the changes a character experiences as tracke d\nfrom the beginning, through the middle, to the end of a screenplay . Most\noften heard in development meetings as in: \u201cWhat\u2019 s the arc of the hero?\u201d\nand \u201cAre these characters arcing enough?\u201d To which you think to yourself:\n\u201cWhat is the arc of my patience to sit here and listen to this?\u201d\nAT THE END OF THE DAY \u2013 A phrase used by agents and\nmanagers to indicate they are about to give you bad news, i.e., \u201cWe love\nyour script and think it would be great for Julia, but at the end of the day\ndoes she really need to do a musical set in the Middle Ages?\u201d  Also when\nyou are most likely to be calle d by said agent or manager with this bad\nnews.\nBLACK HOLES  \u2013 Thes e are the spots in your beat sheet, step\noutline, or places on The Board that you have no idea how to fill with story .\nLooking at black holes will cause you to wonder how you got into the\nbusiness. You could have gone to law school or joined the Army but no,\nyou had to do this!\nBLOCK COMEDY  \u2013 A low budg et, domestically  oriented, family\nfilm. It is so low tech and requires so few company moves, you can shoot it\non the backlot \u2014 as they did with The \u2018Burbs . I first heard this term at\nDisney when we were discussing a script we had sold to them called Poker\nNight . And it all takes  place \u2014 on the block. \u201cWe want more of these ,\u201d said\nthe executive in char ge. \u201cY ou know , a block comedy!\u201d I had never heard the\nterm before. It may just be his term, but I like it, and now it\u2019 s mine.\nBOARD, THE  \u2013 A corkboard, blackboard, or artist\u2019 s notebook that\ndivides a screenplay-in-progress into four equal parts: Act One, the first\nhalf of Act Two, the second half of Act Two, and Act Three. It is the\nworkout space where, using index cards, pushpins, colored Pentels, etc.,\nyou can try your best ideas and see what they look like, and then begin to\nwinnow them down. If done right, you\u2019ll end up with 40 scenes that make a\nmovie, all laid out neatly on The Board in your office or workroom\u2026 along\nwith blood, sweat, and tears.\nBREAKING THE FOUR TH WALL  \u2013 A filmmaker \u2019s inside joke\nthat makes the audience realize they are watching a film. The fourth wall is\nan invisible one that allows the audience to look into the lives of characters\non stage. And breaking it lets the characters, essentially , look back. This\n\u201ctakes you out of the story .\u201d Sometimes it works, as when Woody Allen\nspeaks to the audience in Annie Hall. But most times it does not, as when\nRobin W illiams \u201cbreaks character\u201d (like in Aladdin ).\nBOOSTER ROCKET  \u2013 There are spots in any screenplay that are\npotentially dull stretches. Usuall y these are found right after \u201cbig moments\u201d\nlike after the Act One break and sections where the action is petering out,\nlike at the end of Act Two. This is a time to stick in a booster rocket to get\nus past these spots. John Candy in Home Alone  is the classic example. The\ntale of a Mom (Catherine O\u2019Hara) getting home to her child is starting to\ndrag around the end of Act Two. So when John Candy and his polka-band\ncohorts show up, it\u2019s just what the script doctor ordered. Another booster\nrocket character is the manicurist in Legally Blonde . She arrives just when\nwe\u2019re growing weary of Elle Woods\u2019 law school saga, just after the break\ninto Act Two of that screenplay . Both these characters rocket us past these\npotential slow spots.\nCALLBACKS  \u2013 Bits, images, character traits, and metaphors that are\nset up in Act One and then recalled later in the movie. Often the callback\nexplains what that obvious set-up was about. In Back to the Futur e, the flier\nupon which Marty McFly\u2019 s girlfriend writes \u201cI Love You\u201d reminds Marty\nof the clock tower and the electric storm in 1955 that he needs to power his\nDeLorean back to 1985. This is a nice callback. Other callbacks are less\nplot-oriented and remind us of a character \u2019s growth, harkening the past to\nshow change or to re-emphasize a joke by reminding us of its origins.\nCREDIT JUMPER  \u2013 You have sold your script to the studio. Then,\nafter your contracted rewrite, you are fired. And when the movie goes into\nproduction, and you are sent drafts of the rewritten version of your script,\nyou are suddenly appalled to find that\u2026 it\u2019s been altered!! Often in stupid\nways: Your hero Bob is now named Carl. Instead of a Pontiac, he drives a\nBuick. Congratulations, you\u2019ve been victimized by a credit jumper , a guy or\ngal who is gunning for writing credit on your movie and thinks  by making\nthese tweaks it will become his or her own. This is why we have WGA\ncredit-arbitration committees to decide who did what. The advantage of\nwriting on spec and being the originator now becomes clear . You have more\nrights than the average credit jumper . It\u2019s up to you to say why specifically\nthis is still your script. And you must! (Isn\u2019 t Hollywood a great town?)\nEXPOSITION  \u2013 Give me the facts, ma\u2019am, just the facts, but please\ndo it in a way that won\u2019 t put me to sleep. Thus, exposition \u2014 like annoying\nplot details, heist plans, and backstories \u2014 can\u2019t be just laid out, it must be\nentertainingly told by crafty screenwriters. To \u201cbury\u201d said exposition is to\ndeal with it in a way that is not deadly dull. The masters of the craft make\nthese irritating facts and figures go down as easily as a spoonful of Maypo.\nFIRST REEL  \u2013 During the era of silent films, film reels were 10\nminutes long, thus the end of the first reel was 10 minutes into the movie.\nFlash forward to Joel Silver , genius producer of such action pictures as Die\nHard and Matrix , who wisely suggests that you have a \u201cwhammy\u201d or a big\naction set piece at the end of every \u201creel.\u201d The First Reel still denotes the\nfirst 10 minutes of a movie and I suggest it be used to introduce every A-\nstory character .\nFOUR-QUADRANT PICTURE  \u2013 The big magilla. The whole ball\nof wax. The mother lode. Audience-wise, if you have a four-quadrant hit,\nyou have won the lottery . The four quadrants are Men Over 25, Men Under\n25, Women Over 25, and Woman Under 25. If you can draw audience from\nall those  quadrants, you are guaranteeing yourself a hit. Why  isn\u2019t every\nmovie a four-quadrant movie? Everyone targets different groups for\ndifferent reasons . As I write today , the single most desirable group is Men\nUnder 25. Most movies are geared to them because they go, with or without\ntheir girlfriends. They are more likely to bring others to their movies than\nthey are likely to be brought to other movies. They are the leading\nindicators of \u201cwho goes.\u201d This may change, but it explains  the movie\nselections at the mall on any given weekend. Have a complaint no one\u2019s\nmaking movies for you? That\u2019 s why. But for the spec screenwriters of the\nworld trying to make a sale, this is invaluable information.\nGENRE  \u2013 After  we get past the main headings of, say, Comedy and\nDrama, genre breaks down into more specific groupings. If it\u2019s a comedy ,\nthen what type of comedy is it? Is it a family film, romantic comedy , spoof,\nor teen comedy? If it\u2019s a drama, is it an action, romance, thrille r, or horror\nmovie? Each of these is a genre that has its own rules, history , and\nexpectations from an audience. And though the fusion of different genres is\nnow de rigueur  in short-attention-span Hollywood (Ron Howard\u2019 s The\nMissing  is a Gothic/W estern), I suggest  one genre per movie, please. Any\nmore and I personally don\u2019 t know what it is, or why I go see it.\nHIGH CONCEPT  \u2013 No one knows exactly how to explain this\nunwieldy term. I know . I\u2019ve asked. What is \u201chigh\u201d about a high concept?\nThe term is fuzzy regarding what it\u2019s trying to describe. Also, I\u2019ve asked\nabout the exact place and time this phrase was coined and have come up\nshort. That said, we know what it means: Die Har d is a high concept movie;\nEnglish Patient  is not. Miss Congeniality  is a high concept movie; Under\nThe Tuscan Sun is not. Mostly  you can divid e it into American (high\nconcept) and European (non-high concept), which also explains why\nAmerican movie s do well and European movies do not \u2014 well, everywhere\nbut Euro pe. I advise you to write as high a high concept movie as you can\nthe first time out, and if you know of the exact terminology or origin of the\nterm \u201chigh concept\u201d e-mail me\u2026 I\u2019ll be in Europe.\nHOOK  \u2013 Ah, le hook!  This is the encapsulation of a movie, be it\ndisplayed on the poster or in the logline, which grabs your attention and\nmakes you want to run, not walk, to the theatre. And when mentioned in\nVariety , it is the thing  that makes you hit yourself on the head and say:\n\u201cWhy didn\u2019 t I think of that?\u201d  Like Proust\u2019 s madeleine , the hook must\nblossom in your mind with possibility and \u201chook\u201d you into wanting more\n\u2014 thus the name. It is a simple  mental picture that promises fun and gives\nyou enough of a peek into the storyline that you can see the potential. A\ngood hook is gold for this reason: It works on anyone who hears it, be it\nagent, producer , studio head, or ticket buyer . A good hook answers: \u201cWhat\nis it?\u201d\nINACTIVE HERO  \u2013 What lays there like a lox on a plate? Who can\u2019t\nbe bothered to get up out of his chair and go answer the door? Why , the\ninactive hero, of course. And since the very definition of a hero is to be\nproactive, the inactive kind must not be a very good thing. Heroes seek,\nstrive, and reach for the stars; they don\u2019t wait for the phone to ring. So if\nyour hero is inactive, tell him to get of f the dime!\nIN PLA Y \u2013 When we say that someone is in play, we mean that they\nhave so much \u201cheat\u201d and are so \u201cdesirable\u201d that the news they are looking\nfor new representation makes the town jump up and down with hysteric joy.\nFor actors who want to leave their agents, for directors and producers who\nhave eschewed their studios when their on-the-lot deal ends and are looking\nfor a new \u201chome ,\u201d being in play means lots of buzz, money , and attention is\nabout to be paid. If you are a screenwriter , this term does not apply to you.\nWhile you very well may be \u201cin play,\u201d to the town it just means you are\n\u201cavailable.\u201d\nLOGLINE OR ONE-LINE  \u2013 A logline is the one- or two-sentence\ndescription of your movie that tells us what it is. It must conta in a type of\nhero (that means a type of person plus an adjective that describes him), the\nantagonist (ditto), and the hero\u2019 s primal goal. It must have irony , and it must\nbloom in our brains with potent ial. A good logline is the coin of the realm\nin Hollywood and can be traded like currency with those who appreciate it.\nMAJOR TURNS  \u2013 The break into Act One, the midpoint, and the\nbreak into Act Three are the major turns of a script. These are conveniently\nfound at the end of each horizontal row on The Board. These are also the\nplaces that need to be paid the most attention. In a pitch you will hang your\nhat on these major turns and if you\u2019re lucky , executives will remember one\nof them.  But you must always have them nailed before you pitch and before\nyou can \u201cbeat out\u201d a screenplay .\nONE-SHEET  \u2013 This is the old timer \u2019s phrase  for \u201cthe poster .\u201d I have\nno idea where this term originat ed, only that it has to do with printing size.\nA one-sheet is the broad sheet that shows the stars, title, and tone of the\nfilm. A good one is gold. One-sheets sell DVDs in the aftermarket, too.\nON THE NOSE  a.k.a. A Little Too on the Nose  \u2013 This is one of my\nfavorite development executive phrases, uttered when a suggestion is\nobvious, unfunn y, or something \u201cwe\u2019ve seen before.\u201d Instead of saying\n\u201cThat\u2019 s obvious, unfunny , and something we\u2019ve seen before,\u201d they say, \u201cIt\nfeels a little on the nose.\u201d You, who have been up all night trying not to be\n\u201con the nose,\u201d now think of this as a tar get suggestion.\nPAGE ONE  \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s a Page One!\u201d This is the despairing cry of the\ndevelopment executive who has been handed a script with a good idea and\nmaybe some good characters and little else. It means that some poor\nschmuck will be assigned to give this a \u201cpage one rewrite.\u201d It is the\nequivalent of an auto body repairman telling the owner of a damaged car:\n\u201cIt\u2019s totaled.\u201d\nPRE-SOLD FRANCHISE  \u2013 When a book, comic book, cartoon, or\nold TV series has a built-in group of fans, it is considered to be a pre-sold\nfranchise. It presumes that a certain number of people are already \u201csold\u201d on\nthe property and will turn up to see it when the movie comes out. This is not\nalways the case \u2014 just ask the producers of The Avengers  and The League\nof Extraor dinary Gentlemen . Still, having any group of potential ticket\nbuyers aware of your movie before you go into production is a head start.\nEven obscure beginnings, like the comic book that spawned Men In Black ,\ngot started from the belief that even a small fan base will get buzz started\nwith moviegoer s. But a pre-sold franchise is also something a spec\nscreenwriter is not likely to own. That should not stop you from creating\nyour own franchises, and I encourage you to create the biggest franchise\npossible.\nPRIMAL  \u2013 What  is basic about a story , a character \u2019s goal, or a movie\npremise is its relation to our inner drives as human beings. Stories of\nsurvival, sex, hunger , and revenge connote immediate interest on our part.\nWe will stop and look when these themes are presented to us. We can\u2019t help\nit. We have  to look. It\u2019s primal. To you, the screenwriter , this means you\nmust ground every action and story in its primal-ness. When characters are\nnot acting like human beings, when they are not being driven primally , odds\nare you are testing the patience of the audience. To ask \u201cIs it primal?\u201d is to\nask \u201cIs this relevant to a caveman?\u201d The answer must be: Y es!\nPROMISE OF THE PREMISE  \u2013 The premise of a movie, its \u201cWhat\nis it?,\u201d can only be proven to be satisfying when we see it in action. What is\nfun, catchy, or hooks our intere st about a movie\u2019 s poster must  be paid off\nonce we get inside the theater . If it is not paid off, we the audience will\nconsider it to be a bad experience. We will feel cheated. The promise of the\npremise are those scenes or scene sequences that exploit the premise to its\nmaximum and are usually found in the fun and games section (pages 30-55)\nof a screenplay . This is the point  where we understand fully what this movie\nis about. This is why we bought our tickets.\nRESIDUALS  \u2013 Lovely lime-green envelopes come through the mail\nto the homes of lucky screenwriters on a quarterly basis. We know what\u2019 s\ninside: money! That explains the desire to get a movie made, for its every\nappearance on TV, every VHS or DVD sale, every foreign manifestation\nwill be tracked by the WGA Residual Department and result in\u2026 more\nresiduals! And the amounts are nothing to sneeze at: I have earned over\n$100,000 in residuals in my career for two movies. And the checks haven\u2019 t\nstopped coming . Get enough movies in production and you will be\nshowered in these bonus checks for the rest of your natural life.\nRUNNING GAGS  \u2013 As opposed to callbacks, which are reminders of\nplot and charact er moments in Act One that are paid off later, running gags\nare repeating themes, character tics, or bits that are interspersed throughout\na movie or a screenplay . As an audience, our appreciation for these gags\ngrows with each use because we feel smart for remembering them and feel\nmore a part of the story because of it. If a character is set up as liking\ncoffee, then whenever he or she walks into a restaurant and orders coffee \u2014\nwe love it! It\u2019s nothing. But we laugh with recognition that we know  this\ncharacter . Running gags can be found in both dramas and comedies as\nrepeating jokes we notice and remember . Note: The running gag must be\ngiven a twist later in the film when a character , by now ready  to change,\ngoes into a caf\u00e9 and orders\u2026 tea.\nSET PIECE  \u2013 A set piece is a stand-alone action scene or sequence. It\nstands alone in that it does less to move the plot forward or enhance our\nidea of who the characters are as it exploits the possibilities of the situation\nor the premise of a movie. Because of this, set pieces are disposable and\ninterchangeable. A \u201cchase scene\u201d that takes place on a freeway and does\nlittle, in itself, to move the plot forward, can be set in a supermarket,\nplayground, or racetrack. That\u2019 s a set piece \u2014 one that can be dropped or\nchanged within the confines of a studio\u2019 s slashing of the budget, a director \u2019s\n\u201cvision,\u201d or a star \u2019s dislike of chase scenes on freeways.\nSIX THINGS THA T NEED FIXING  \u2013 This is my term. And I use it\nall the time. It is defined as the list of a hero\u2019 s minor character flaws,\nenemies and rivals that bully him, and a wish list that \u2014 if we like the hero\nenough, and think he deserves help \u2014 get \u201cfixed\u201d later in the film. I\npersonally find myself going back and forth between Act One (set-up) and\nAct Two or Three (pay-of f) and adding things to the list as I go. We as an\naudience like to see the Six Things That Need Fixing get paid off later in\nthe scrip t \u2014 the more the merrier. It\u2019s thoroughly enjoyable to see those\npay-of fs. But you have to put the flaw in there in the beginning to make the\npay-of f work.\nSTAKES ARE RAISED  \u2013 This is a term that is frequently heard in\ndevelopment meetings. Also known as the \u201cticking clock\u201d or the \u201cmidpoint\nbump,\u201d it means the raising of the level of tension. Suddenly from out of\nnowhere at the midpoint, some new thing \u2014 an even bigger and more\nunexpected thing than we\u2019v e seen before, and one that seems\ninsurmountable \u2014 becomes a problem for our hero. You must  be sure the\nstakes are raised  at the midpoint to give the hero new challenges and lead\nhim to his ultimate win.\nSTRUCTURE  \u2013 After \u201cconcep t,\u201d the single most important quality of\na good screenpl ay is its structu re. Very often a producer or executive will\napplaud the idea, love the writing, and toss out the script because the\nstructure is a mess. They cannot see how the movie is organized. And\nwithout that, they often don\u2019t know what it is. Good structure is one of\nseveral prime components that will help sell your script \u2014 and is the easiest\nto learn. So learn it! It is part of the language we use to communicate with\neach other in development meetings, so you must be fluent.\nSUBTEXT  \u2013 That part of a scene, sequence, or screenplay that lies\nbeneath the surface and is in fact its real meaning. The subtext of an\nargument between a soon-to-be-divorced couple about buying apples is not\nwhether they choose Macintosh  or Pink Lady but the fact that the couple is\nhaving problems \u2014 and an argument about produce proves it! Do not hit us\nover the head with what\u2019 s really going on, it\u2019s much more subtle \u2014 and\nbetter screenwritin\u2019 \u2014 to hide the meaning. It\u2019s not what they\u2019re talking\nabout, it\u2019 s what they\u2019re not talking about that makes these moments so rich.\nTHEMA TIC PREMISE  \u2013 What  is this movie about? Yes, even the\nsilliest monster movie or most spastic comedy has to be \u201cabout something.\u201d\nIf it\u2019s not, it\u2019s not a good movie . In essence every good movie is a debate\nabout the pros and the cons of a particular point of view . It is a question\nraised and answ ered by the movie. The place to stick that question is up\nfront, loud and clear . It is frequently spoken by a minor character to the\nhero in the form of a question early on, like on page 5, and sets the debate\ninto motion that will be proven , one way or the other , in the course of the\nmovie. This question and debate is the movie\u2019 s thematic premise.\nTHESIS, ANTITHESIS, SYNTHESIS  a.k.a. Act One, Act Two, and\nAct Three \u2013 Thesis, antithesis, and synthesis describe the thematic\nprogression of the hero\u2019 s journe y. In Act One, the hero\u2019 s world is set up. In\nAct Two that world is turned on its head; it is the upside down  version of\nwhat he left behind. But by mastering this surreal new world, the hero gains\nthe know ledge to combine what was and its opposite to form a synthesis of\neverything he has learned. That synthesis occurs in Act Thre e. It is not\nenough for the hero to survive the journey; he must transform his world in\norder to truly be great.\nTRACKING  \u2013 If you have a hot script, either on its way out to the\ntown or about to be, odds are it will be \u201ctracked\u201d by development\nexecutives who closely follow its progress. They have even set up an inter-\nstudio Intranet to talk to each other about scripts and whether or not the\nscript is worth the effort of pursuing for purchase. Based on the concept,\ntrack record of the writer , and word of mouth, the script will be considered\neither hot or not. Sometimes, executives will try to outfox each other with\nmisinformation on a hot script, but this sort of maneuver can backfire on\nthem next time. This current tracking system is one of several reasons,\nmostly econom ic, that the spec sale frenzy has ended in Hollywood.\nTracking scripts  in this way cuts down on the chances of any of the studios\nor their buyers getting burned.\nWHIFF OF DEA TH \u2013 The added extra bonus found in the All Is Lost\npoint on page 75 of a well-str uctured screenplay . It is that very special\nmoment where something metaphorically , or actually , dies. And since this is\nthe place where the mentor bites the big one, the moment when best friends\nand allies you thought looked sick now kick the bucket, and the spot where\nSpot is removed , this is the perfect place to put such story beats. The All Is\nLost point is rife with the whiff of death because it marks the end of the\nworld as is and the beginning of a new world the hero will create from this\nseeming end.\n+/- \u2013 This symbol indicates the emotional change of a good scene. I\nfirst heard about this from Robert McKee. He believes that every scene\nshould mark a sea change like this, going from one emotional extreme to\nanother . And he\u2019s right. If you think of each scene as a mini- movie, you\nmust have a befor e snapshot and an after  snapshot to show this change.\nDeciding what the emotional shift in each of your scenes involves is the key\nelement in making that scene a success. When I am using index cards and\nmy corkboard to work out the structure of a movie, I mark each card with\nthis symbol and make sure I know what the emotional chang e is in each\nscene.\n>< \u2013 This symbol represents the conflict in each scene. When the\nscene starts, who has a goal, who\u2019s in the way, who wins? These questions\ncan be boiled down into one neat statement using this symbol to denote\nwho\u2019 s up against whom. Don\u2019 t start a scene unless you have figured out\nwho your players are and what they want.\nBlake Snyder joined the family business at age 8, working as a\nvoice talent for his father , Emm y-winning TV producer , Ken Snyder\n(Roger Ramjet , Big Blue Marble ).\nBlake began his career writing for the Disney TV series, Kids\nIncorporated , penning 13 episodes before turning to writing spec\nscreenplays full time.
