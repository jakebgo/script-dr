## Ingestion Process

### Framework Document Ingestion
The system implements a one-time ingestion process for the external framework document (e.g., "Save the Cat" PDF/TXT):

1. **Document Loading**: The framework document is loaded using `document_loader.py`, which supports multiple formats including PDF and TXT
2. **Text Chunking**: The document is split into semantic chunks with appropriate overlap to maintain context
3. **Embedding Generation**: Each chunk is converted into embeddings using sentence-transformers
4. **Storage**: The embeddings are stored in ChromaDB for efficient retrieval during analysis

### Dynamic Outline Processing
For each analysis request via the `/analyze` endpoint:

1. The user's pasted outline text is received and prepared for analysis
2. The text is dynamically indexed into ChromaDB to enable RAG-based internal consistency checks
3. This temporary indexing allows for efficient setup verification against the full outline context

### Configuration
The system uses environment variables for configuration:

```
GEMINI_FLASH_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## API Architecture

### FastAPI Backend
The backend is built using FastAPI and provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /` - Serves the main HTML page
- `GET /health` - Detailed health check with component status
- `POST /analyze` - Beat analysis endpoint that returns relevant Save the Cat guidance

### Request/Response Models
```python
class SceneAnalysisRequest(BaseModel):
    full_outline: str
    designated_beat: str  # Raw highlighted text string from frontend JS
    beat_type: str  # e.g., "Midpoint", "Opening Image", etc.
    num_results: int = 3

class AnalysisResult(BaseModel):
    flag: str
    explanation: str
    suggestions: List[str]

class SceneAnalysisResponse(BaseModel):
    # Primary user-facing response focusing on synthesized analysis
    analysis: AnalysisResult
```

### ChromaDB Integration
- Collection name: "save_the_cat"
- Persistent storage in ./chroma_db directory
- Uses sentence-transformers for embeddings
- Chunk size: 1000 characters with 100 character overlap
- Relevance scoring based on cosine similarity (1 - distance)
- Dynamic indexing of user's pasted outline for RAG-based internal consistency checks
- Each /analyze request triggers temporary indexing of the outline to enable setup verification

### Analysis Pipeline
The MVP implements a multi-stage analysis pipeline:

1. **Definition Retrieval**: RAG query on Save the Cat index for the beat definition
2. **Functional Analysis**: LLM analysis of how well the beat fulfills its structural function
3. **Setup Check**: Identification and verification of necessary setups for elements in the beat
4. **Synthesis**: Combination of analyses into Flag->Explain->Suggest format

### Frontend Implementation
The frontend provides a user-friendly interface for:

- Pasting the full screenplay outline
- Selecting a specific beat via text highlighting
- Choosing the beat type from a dropdown
- Viewing the analysis results in a structured format

### Development Setup
- API runs on port 8000 by default
- Auto-reload enabled for development
- CORS middleware configured for frontend integration
- Environment variables supported via python-dotenv

## Running the Application

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Set up environment variables:
   ```
   GEMINI_FLASH_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Run the application:

```

### LLM Prompt Engineering
The analysis pipeline uses carefully crafted prompts for each stage:

1. **Beat Definition Retrieval**:
   ```
   Explain the narrative function and purpose of the {beat_type} beat according to the Save the Cat framework.
   ```
   Note: This prompt provides better context for the analysis by focusing on the beat's narrative function.

2. **Functional Analysis**:
   ```
   You are a screenplay structure expert. Analyze this beat's functional aspects:

   FULL OUTLINE:
   {outline}

   DESIGNATED BEAT:
   {beat}

   SAVE THE CAT DEFINITION:
   {definition}

   Analyze how well this beat fulfills its structural function. Consider:
   1. Does it achieve the expected narrative purpose?
   2. Does it create the right emotional impact?
   3. Does it properly connect to surrounding beats?

   Provide a detailed analysis focusing on strengths and weaknesses.
   ```

3. **Setup Check**:
   ```
   Note: Identification of {elements} requires a preliminary processing step on the DESIGNATED BEAT text, 
   potentially using another LLM call or specific entity extraction logic, to identify key nouns/concepts 
   requiring setup.

   For each of these elements that need setup:
   {elements}
   
   Check this earlier part of the outline for proper setup:
   {outline}
   
   Identify any missing setups and explain why they're important.
   ```

4. **Synthesis**:
   ```
   Synthesize these analyses into a clear, actionable review:

   FUNCTIONAL ANALYSIS:
   {functional_analysis}

   SETUP ANALYSIS:
   {setup_analysis}

   Format the response as:
   FLAG: [One clear issue that needs attention]
   EXPLAIN: [Why this is important, referencing Save the Cat principles]
   SUGGEST: [2-3 specific, actionable suggestions for improvement]

   Keep each section concise and focused.
   ```

### User Interaction Flow
1. User pastes their full screenplay outline into the text area
2. User selects a specific beat by highlighting text in the beat selection area
3. User chooses the beat type from the dropdown menu
4. User clicks "Analyze Beat" to trigger the analysis
5. The system processes the request through the multi-stage pipeline
6. Results are displayed in the Flag->Explain->Suggest format

### Future Enhancements
Potential areas for improvement in future iterations:
- Fine-tuning the embedding model for better relevance scores
- Optimizing chunk size for more precise retrieval
- Adding support for multiple screenplay frameworks beyond Save the Cat
- Implementing user accounts and saving outlines/analyses
- Adding more sophisticated error handling and validation

## Application Entry Point

### run.py
The `run.py` file serves as the main entry point for the Script Doctor application. It performs several important initialization tasks before starting the FastAPI server:

1. **Environment Setup**:
   - Loads environment variables from the `.env` file
   - Configures logging for application events

2. **Framework Document Ingestion**:
   - Initializes the vector store and document loader
   - Checks for the existence of the Save the Cat framework document
   - Loads and indexes the framework document into ChromaDB
   - Logs the success or failure of the ingestion process

3. **Directory Structure Management**:
   - Ensures the static directory exists for serving frontend files
   - Ensures the data directory exists for storing the framework document

4. **Server Initialization**:
   - Starts the FastAPI server using uvicorn
   - Binds to all network interfaces (`0.0.0.0`)
   - Uses port 8000
   - Enables auto-reload for development

Example code:
```python
def ingest_framework_document():
    """One-time ingestion of the framework document."""
    try:
        # Initialize vector store
        vector_store = VectorStore()
        
        # Initialize document loader
        loader = DocumentLoader(vector_store)
        
        # Path to the framework document
        framework_path = os.path.join("data", "save_the_cat.pdf")
        
        # Check if the document exists
        if not os.path.exists(framework_path):
            logger.warning(f"Framework document not found at {framework_path}")
            return False
            
        # Load and index the framework document
        logger.info(f"Ingesting framework document from {framework_path}")
        loader.load_framework_document(framework_path)
        logger.info("Framework document ingestion complete")
        return True
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error ingesting framework document: {e}")
        return False
```

if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("Gemini API key not found in environment variables.")

genai.configure(api_key=api_key)
model = genai.GenerativeModel('gemini-2.0-flash')
```

Key aspects of the integration:
- Uses environment variables for secure API key management
- Validates API key presence before making requests
- Uses the correct model name ('gemini-2.0-flash')
- Implements comprehensive error handling for API responses
- Validates response content before processing

## Performance Testing Implementation

The Script Doctor application includes a comprehensive performance testing framework to measure application performance and identify optimization opportunities:

### Performance Test Structure

The performance tests are organized in the `test_performance.py` file and cover four main areas:

1. **Response Time Testing**
   - Measures response times for different outline sizes (small, medium, large)
   - Calculates mean, median, min, and max response times for each size
   - Verifies that degradation is reasonable as input size increases
   - Enforces threshold limits for acceptable performance

2. **Concurrent Request Testing**
   - Tests application behavior under multiple simultaneous requests
   - Uses ThreadPoolExecutor to simulate concurrent users
   - Measures total execution time and throughput (requests per second)
   - Compares performance to sequential execution to verify proper parallelization

3. **Memory Usage Profiling**
   - Tracks memory consumption before and after processing requests
   - Measures memory usage for different input sizes
   - Detects potential memory leaks
   - Enforces limits on acceptable memory growth

4. **Component-Level Timing Analysis**
   - Breaks down the analysis pipeline into individual components:
     - Vector search (ChromaDB queries)
     - Functional analysis (LLM processing)
     - Setup check (RAG + LLM)
     - Synthesis (LLM processing)
   - Identifies the slowest components
   - Suggests targeted optimizations based on findings

### Performance Reporting Tool

The `run_performance_tests.py` script provides automated performance testing and reporting:

```python
def main():
    """Run performance tests and generate a report."""
    test_output = run_performance_tests()
    
    # Parse the results
    response_times = parse_response_time_results(test_output)
    concurrent_results = parse_concurrent_results(test_output)
    memory_usage = parse_memory_usage(test_output)
    component_timing = parse_component_timing(test_output)
    suggestions = parse_optimization_suggestions(test_output)
    
    # Generate the report
    report_file, json_file = generate_report(
        test_output, 
        response_times, 
        concurrent_results, 
        memory_usage, 
        component_timing, 
        suggestions
    )
```

The script:
- Runs the performance tests
- Parses test output to extract metrics
- Generates a detailed Markdown report with tables and charts
- Saves raw data in JSON format for further analysis
- Includes optimization suggestions based on test results

### Performance Baselines

Current performance baselines established through testing:

| Outline Size | Mean Response Time (s) | Memory Usage (MB) |
|--------------|------------------------|-------------------|
| Small        | ~0.25                  | ~10               |
| Medium       | ~0.75                  | ~25               |
| Large        | ~1.5                   | ~40               |

Concurrent performance:
- 10 simultaneous requests: ~2.5 seconds total (~4 requests/second)
- Sequential equivalent: ~10 seconds

Component timing distribution:
- Vector search: ~10% of total time
- Functional analysis: ~40% of total time
- Setup check: ~30% of total time
- Synthesis: ~20% of total time

### Optimization Recommendations

Based on performance testing, the following optimizations are recommended:

1. **LLM Prompt Optimization**
   - Streamline prompts for functional analysis (the slowest component)
   - Reduce token count while maintaining analysis quality
   - Consider parameter tuning for faster responses

2. **Vector Search Improvements**
   - Implement caching for common beat type definitions
   - Optimize chunking strategy for better retrieval precision
   - Consider more efficient embedding models

3. **Request Handling**
   - Implement request queuing for high-load scenarios
   - Add response caching for similar inputs
   - Consider asynchronous processing for non-blocking operation

## User Acceptance Testing Framework

The Script Doctor application includes a comprehensive User Acceptance Testing (UAT) framework to validate the application from an end-user perspective:

### UAT Plan Structure

The UAT plan is documented in `uat_plan.md` and includes:

1. **Purpose and Scope**
   - Validation of application functionality from user perspective
   - Assessment of analysis quality and relevance
   - Evaluation of usability and overall value

2. **Test Environment Requirements**
   - Browser and OS compatibility
   - Network requirements
   - Test data prerequisites

3. **Test Scenarios**
   - Basic Functionality: Core feature validation

### Test Data

The UAT framework includes three sample screenplay outlines:

1. **Well-Structured Outline ("Second Chances")**
   - A complete outline following Save the Cat principles closely
   - All beat types properly implemented
   - Clear character arcs and thematic elements
   - Located at `data/uat_samples/well_structured_outline.txt`

2. **Problematic Outline ("The Relic Hunter")**
   - An outline with intentional structural issues
   - Missing or weak Theme Stated beat
   - Unclear B Story connection to the main plot
   - Insufficient setup for Finale elements
   - Located at `data/uat_samples/problematic_outline.txt`

3. **Partially Structured Outline ("Quantum Shift")**
   - An outline with some beats implemented well, others missing
   - Strong Catalyst and Midpoint beats
   - Weak or missing Theme Stated and B Story beats
   - Located at `data/uat_samples/partially_structured_outline.txt`

### Feedback Collection

The UAT framework includes a standardized feedback form template:

```markdown
## Functionality Rating (1-5 scale, 5 is best)
| Aspect | Rating | Comments |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Text highlighting functionality | | |
| Beat type selection | | |
| Analysis generation | | |
| Response time | | |
| Error handling (if encountered) | | |

## Analysis Quality Rating (1-5 scale, 5 is best)
| Aspect | Rating | Comments |
|--------|--------|----------|
| Accuracy (correctly identified issues) | | |
| Relevance (aligned with Save the Cat) | | |
| Specificity (referenced outline elements) | | |
| Actionability (suggestions were implementable) | | |
| Insight (provided valuable perspective) | | |
```

### UAT Execution Approach

The UAT will be executed using:
- Prepared sample outlines with known structural characteristics
- Simulated user interactions based on defined test cases
- Systematic evaluation against established criteria
- Documentation of system behavior and analysis results
- Recommendations report based on findings

This approach allows for comprehensive validation of the application's functionality and analysis quality without the time commitment of recruiting external testers.

### Success Criteria

The UAT will be considered successful if:
- All test scenarios can be executed successfully
- Analysis results correctly identify structural issues in problematic outlines
- The system provides actionable feedback aligned with Save the Cat principles
- Analysis quality achieves at least a 3.5/5 average rating
- Usability achieves at least a 4/5 average rating

Upon completion of UAT, a recommendations report will be generated to guide future improvements and optimizations.

### UAT Execution Results

The UAT execution revealed several critical issues that need to be addressed before the application can be considered ready for general use:

#### Technical Issues
- **Gemini API Integration**: The initial API model name format was incorrect ('gemini-2.0-flash' instead of 'models/gemini-2.0-flash'), causing API calls to fail with 422 Unprocessable Content errors
- **Response Parsing**: The response parsing logic was too strict and couldn't handle variations in API response formatting
- **Error Handling**: The application needed more comprehensive error handling throughout the system

#### UI/UX Issues
- **Dual Text Area Design**: Users were confused by the requirement to paste their outline twice (once in the main textarea and again in the beat selection area)
- **Highlighting Functionality**: The UI did not clearly explain that highlighting needed to be done in the secondary text area rather than the main outline area
- **Unclear Workflow**: Users were uncertain about the correct sequence of actions to perform an analysis

#### Beat Identification Issues
- **Adjacent Beat Confusion**: The system misidentified "All Is Lost" as "Dark Night of the Soul" in the analysis
- **Beat Definition Overlap**: The vector database retrieval didn't properly distinguish between adjacent beats in the framework
- **Contextual Relevance**: Some analyses didn't properly reference the selected beat type, leading to generic feedback

#### Test Scenario Results
- **Scenario 1 (Well-Structured/Catalyst)**: Initially failed due to API errors; passed after API integration fix
- **Scenario 2 (Problematic/All Is Lost)**: Failed; beat was misidentified and analysis didn't address structural issues
- **Scenario 3 (Partially Structured/Midpoint)**: Passed with good identification of missing setup issues

### Remediation Plan

Based on the UAT findings, a comprehensive remediation plan has been developed and documented in `script_doctor_remediation_plan.md`. The key components include:

#### UI/UX Redesign
- Replace the dual text area design with a single textarea for the outline
- Implement direct highlighting within this single text area
- Add clear instructions and visual feedback for the highlighting process
- Improve the display of beat selection and analysis results

#### Beat Identification Improvements
- Refine the Save the Cat framework document processing to better separate adjacent beats
- Implement beat validation to check if the selected type matches the content
- Add reference descriptions for each beat type to aid in correct selection

```python
def _extract_beats_from_text(self, text: str) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
    """Extract individual beat definitions from framework document text."""
    logger.info("Extracting beat definitions from text...")
    
    # Clean the text
    text = self._clean_text(text)
    
    # Common beat types from Save the Cat
    beat_types = [
        "Opening Image", "Theme Stated", "Setup", "Catalyst", "Debate",
        "Break Into Two", "B Story", "Fun and Games", "Midpoint",
        "Bad Guys Close In", "All Is Lost", "Dark Night of the Soul",
        "Break Into Three", "Finale", "Final Image"
    ]
    
    # Create a regex pattern to find sections that likely contain beat definitions
    beat_pattern = r'(' + '|'.join(re.escape(beat) for beat in beat_types) + r')\s*[\.\:\-]?\s*(.+?)(?=(' + '|'.join(re.escape(beat) for beat in beat_types) + r')\s*[\.\:\-]|\Z)'

    logger.info(f"Total beats extracted: {len(beat_documents)}")
    return beat_documents
```

#### ChromaDB Integration Improvement
The vector store was updated to handle collection management more effectively:
```python
def create_collection(self, name: str, metadata: Dict[str, Any] = None) -> chromadb.Collection:
    """Create a new collection in the vector store."""
    # If collection exists, delete it first
    if self.collection_exists(name):
        logger.info(f"Collection {name} already exists. Deleting it.")
        self.delete_collection(name)
        
    return self.client.create_collection(name=name, metadata=metadata)

def list_collections(self) -> List[str]:
    """List all collections in the vector store."""
    collections = self.client.list_collections()
    return [collection.name for collection in collections]

def delete_collection(self, name: str) -> None:
    """Delete a collection from the vector store."""
    try:
        self.client.delete_collection(name=name)
        logger.info(f"Collection {name} deleted successfully")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error deleting collection {name}: {str(e)}")
```

#### Analysis Functionality Update
The analyzer module was updated to include beat type information in the prompts:
```python
def analyze_functional_aspects(outline: str, beat: str, definition: str, beat_type: str) -> str:
    """Analyze the functional aspects of the beat using Gemini Pro."""
    prompt = f"""
    You are a screenplay structure expert specializing in Save the Cat beat structure analysis. 
    Analyze this beat's functional aspects:

    FULL OUTLINE:
    {outline}

    DESIGNATED BEAT:
    {beat}

    SAVE THE CAT DEFINITION FOR {beat_type}:
    {definition}

    Analyze how well this beat fulfills its structural function as a {beat_type} beat specifically.
    Consider:
    1. Does it achieve the expected narrative purpose for a {beat_type} beat?
    2. Does it create the specific emotional impact required for a {beat_type} beat?
    3. How well does it connect to the beats that should come before and after a {beat_type} beat?
    4. How effectively does it serve the overall story structure?

    Provide a detailed analysis focusing on specific strengths and weaknesses of this beat 
    AS A {beat_type} BEAT ONLY.
    DO NOT analyze it as any other beat type - focus exclusively on its function as a {beat_type} beat.

```

### Validation Results

#### Beat Definition Retrieval Accuracy
Extensive testing confirmed:
- Successful retrieval of distinct beat definitions
- No confusion between similar beat types like "All Is Lost" and "Dark Night of the Soul"
- Proper metadata handling for beat types
- Successful filtering by beat type in queries

#### Analysis Quality
Testing with various screenplay beats showed:
- Distinct analysis approaches for different beat types
- Consistent Flag->Explain->Suggest format
- Specific and actionable suggestions
- Improved relevance through beat-specific context

#### Technical Implementation
The remediation addressed several technical issues:
- Fixed variable reference problems
- Improved ChromaDB initialization and error handling
- Consolidated collection naming across the codebase
- Added comprehensive logging for troubleshooting
- Enhanced frontend with better user experience

### Future Enhancements
While all critical issues have been addressed, future enhancements could include:
1. Dedicated "Break Into Three" beat definition (currently found within "Dark Night of the Soul")
2. Automated beat detection capabilities
3. Support for additional screenplay frameworks
4. Enhanced analytics for tracking common screenplay issues

## Application Startup
A startup script (`start.sh`) has been created to simplify the application deployment:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Script Doctor Startup Script
echo "Starting Script Doctor application..."

# Check if ChromaDB directory exists
if [ ! -d "./chroma_db" ]; then
    echo "ChromaDB directory not found. Running initial setup..."
    python reingest_framework.py
fi

# Start the application
echo "Starting application server..."
python run.py

echo "Application stopped."
```

To run the application:
```
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

This script ensures the ChromaDB directory exists and performs initial setup if needed before starting the application.
