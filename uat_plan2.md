Script Doctor - UAT Round 2 Plan: Remediation Validation
Status: PREPARATION COMPLETE - READY FOR EXECUTION

1. Purpose and Scope
Purpose: To validate the effectiveness of the remediation efforts undertaken following UAT Round 1. Specifically, this round aims to confirm that critical UI/UX issues, beat definition inaccuracies, and analysis quality problems have been resolved from an end-user perspective.
Scope: This testing focuses primarily on the areas addressed in the remediation plan:
Usability of the redesigned single-textarea UI and highlighting workflow.
Accuracy of beat definition retrieval and analysis, particularly for previously confused beats (e.g., All Is Lost vs. Dark Night of the Soul).
Clarity, relevance, and actionability of the synthesized Flag -> Explain -> Suggest feedback.
Regression testing to ensure core functionality remains stable.
Out of Scope: Exhaustive testing of all beat types or advanced features not directly related to the remediation fixes. Performance testing (baseline established previously).

2. Testers & Environment
Testers: A mix of previous (Round 1) and new testers has been assembled:
- 3 testers from Round 1 (screenwriter, writing instructor, film student)
- 2 new testers (QA professional, screenplay consultant)
Environment: Application deployed and accessible at http://localhost:8000. All testers have been provided access instructions.

3. Test Data
Primary Focus: Use the same outlines that caused issues in Round 1:
Problematic Outline: Essential for testing the fix for beat definition confusion (All Is Lost / Dark Night) and analysis quality on difficult content.
Partially Structured Outline: Useful for re-testing setup checks and general analysis.
Secondary:
Well-Structured Outline: For basic regression testing (ensuring fixes didn't break standard analysis).
Status: All test data is prepared and available in the data/uat_samples/ directory.

4. Test Scenarios & Cases (Targeted Validation)
Scenario 1: UI/UX Validation
Objective: Verify the redesigned UI (single text area, direct highlighting) is intuitive and solves previous confusion.
Test Cases:
TC-R2-01: Using any outline, successfully paste text, highlight a specific section intended as a beat, select the beat type from the dropdown, and trigger analysis. Evaluate ease of use and clarity.
TC-R2-02: Verify visual feedback (highlight confirmation, loading indicators) works as expected.

Scenario 2: Beat Definition Accuracy Validation
Objective: Confirm the fix for confusing adjacent beat definitions (e.g., All Is Lost vs. Dark Night).
Test Cases:
TC-R2-03: Using the Problematic Outline, highlight the section intended as "All Is Lost", select "All Is Lost" type, analyze. Verify the 'Explain' section correctly references All Is Lost principles.
TC-R2-04: Using the Problematic Outline, highlight the section intended as "Dark Night of the Soul", select "Dark Night of the Soul" type, analyze. Verify the 'Explain' section correctly references Dark Night principles and is distinct from TC-R2-03.
TC-R2-05: Using the Well-Structured Outline, analyze a clearly defined beat (e.g., Midpoint). Verify the correct definition is referenced.

Scenario 3: Analysis Quality & Relevance Validation
Objective: Assess if the Flag->Explain->Suggest output is now clearer, more relevant, and actionable, especially for previously problematic cases.
Test Cases:
TC-R2-06: Re-evaluate the analysis results from TC-R2-03 (Problematic Outline / All Is Lost). Assess clarity of Flag, accuracy of Explain, and relevance/actionability of Suggest. Compare mentally to Round 1 results if possible.
TC-R2-07: Using the Partially Structured Outline, re-analyze the Midpoint (or another beat where setup issues were relevant). Assess clarity and actionability of the Setup Check feedback within the synthesized result.

Scenario 4: Basic Regression Check
Objective: Ensure the remediation fixes haven't negatively impacted core functionality on standard input.
Test Cases:
TC-R2-08: Using the Well-Structured Outline, analyze the Catalyst beat. Verify a reasonable, structurally sound analysis is produced without errors.

Status: All test cases have been documented in detail in the Test Execution Guide.

5. Evaluation Criteria (Focus on Improvement)
UI Usability: Is the single text area and highlighting workflow significantly clearer and easier to use than the previous version? (Yes/No/Partially + Comments)
Beat Definition Accuracy: Does the analysis consistently reference the correct framework definition for the selected beat type, especially resolving the All Is Lost/Dark Night confusion? (Yes/No + Comments)
Feedback Quality (Flag->Explain->Suggest): Is the synthesized output noticeably clearer, more relevant to the designated beat, and more actionable compared to Round 1 feedback? (Scale 1-5 Improvement + Comments)
Stability: Did the application perform without critical errors during the targeted tests? (Yes/No + Issue Description if No)

6. Feedback Collection
Status: A standardized feedback form has been created for testers to document their observations after each test case.
Key sections include:
- UI Usability assessment
- Beat Definition Accuracy validation
- Feedback Quality rating (1-5 scale)
- Stability confirmation
- Specific questions about the resolution of Round 1 issues
- Open-ended feedback sections

7. Test Execution & Timeline
Preparation: COMPLETED - Test environment setup, test materials prepared, testers briefed.
Testing Phase: SCHEDULED - [Start Date] to [End Date] (2 days)
   - Day 1: TC-R2-01, TC-R2-02, TC-R2-03, TC-R2-04
   - Day 2: TC-R2-05, TC-R2-06, TC-R2-07, TC-R2-08
Analysis Phase: SCHEDULED - [Date] (1 day)

8. Success Criteria (Validation Focus)
UAT Round 2 will be considered successful if:
Testers confirm the critical UI/UX confusion from Round 1 is resolved.
Testers confirm the confusion between "All Is Lost" / "Dark Night of the Soul" definitions/analysis is resolved.
Feedback Quality ratings show noticeable improvement (e.g., average improvement score >= 3.5/5).
No new critical bugs related to core functionality are introduced by the fixes.

9. Next Steps
- Send final confirmation emails to testers
- Verify test environment availability on testing days
- Prepare test coordinator to monitor testing sessions
- Gather and organize feedback as it's submitted
- Schedule debrief meeting with development team
- Prepare templates for final UAT Round 2 report
- Plan for potential immediate fixes if critical issues are discovered
